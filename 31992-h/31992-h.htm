<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f</span> you enter Belfast Harbour early in
the morning on the mail steamer from
Fleetwood you will see far ahead of
you a smudge of smoke. At first it is
nothing but the apex of a great triangle
formed by the heights on one side, the
green wooded shores on the other, and
the horizon astern. As you go on the
triangle becomes narrower, the blue waters
smoother, and the ship glides on in a
triangle of her own—a triangle of white
foam that is parallel to the green triangle
of the shore. Behind you the
Copeland Lighthouse keeps guard over
the sunrise and the tumbling surges of
the Channel, before you is the cloud of
smoke that joins the narrowing shores<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
like a gray canopy; and there is no sound
but the rush of foam past the ship’s
side.</p>

<p>You seem to be making straight for a
gray mud flat; but as you approach you
see a narrow lane of water opening in the
mud and shingle. Two low banks, like
the banks of a canal, thrust out their
ends into the waters of the lough; and
presently, her speed reduced to dead slow,
the ship enters between these low mud
banks, which are called the Twin Islands.
So narrow is the lane that as she enters
the water rises on the shingle banks and
flows in waves on either side of her like
two gray horses with white manes that
canter slowly along, a solemn escort,
until the channel between the islands
is passed. Day and night, winter and
summer, these two gray horses are always
waiting; no ship ever surprises them
asleep; no ship enters but they rise up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and shake their manes and accompany
her with their flowing, cantering motion
along the confines of their territory. And
when you have passed the gates that they
guard you are in Belfast Harbour, in still
and muddy water that smells of the land
and not of the sea; for you seem already
to be far from the things of the sea.</p>

<p>As you have entered the narrow channel
a new sound, also far different from the
liquid sounds of the sea, falls on your
ear; at first a low sonorous murmuring
like the sound of bees in a giant hive,
that rises to a ringing continuous music—the
multitudinous clamour of thousands
of blows of metal on metal. And turning
to look whence the sound arises you seem
indeed to have left the last of the things
of the sea behind you; for on your left,
on the flattest of the mud flats, arises a
veritable forest of iron; a leafless forest,
of thousands upon thousands of bare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
rusty trunks and branches that tower
higher than any forest trees in our land,
and look like the ruins of some giant
grove submerged by the sea in the brown
autumn of its life, stripped of its leaves
and laid bare again, the dead and rusty
remnants of a forest. There is nothing
with any broad or continuous surface—only
thousands and thousands of iron
branches with the gray sky and the smoke
showing through them everywhere, giant
cobwebs hanging between earth and the
sky, intricate, meaningless networks of
trunks and branches and sticks and twigs
of iron.</p>

<p>But as you glide nearer still you see
that the forest is not lifeless, nor its
branches deserted. From the bottom to
the topmost boughs it is crowded with a
life that at first seems like that of mites
in the interstices of some rotting fabric,
and then like birds crowding the branches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of the leafless forest, and finally appears
as a multitude of pigmy men swarming
and toiling amid the skeleton iron structures
that are as vast as cathedrals and
seem as frail as gossamer. It is from
them that the clamour arises, the clamour
that seemed so gentle and musical a mile
away, and that now, as you come closer,
grows strident and deafening. Of all the
sounds produced by man’s labour in the
world this sound of a great shipbuilding
yard is the most painful. Only the
harshest materials and the harshest actions
are engaged in producing it: iron
struck upon iron, or steel smitten upon
steel, or steel upon iron, or iron upon
steel—that and nothing else, day in, day
out, year in and year out, a million times
a minute. It is an endless, continuous
birth-agony, that should herald the appearance
of some giant soul. And great
indeed should be the overture to such an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
agony; for it is here that of fire and steel,
and the sweat and pain of millions of
hours of strong men’s labour, were born
those two giant children that were destined
by man finally to conquer the sea.</p>

<p>In this awful womb the <i>Titanic</i> took
shape. For months and months in that
monstrous iron enclosure there was nothing
that had the faintest likeness to a
ship; only something that might have
been the iron scaffolding for the naves of
half-a-dozen cathedrals laid end to end.
Far away, furnaces were smelting thousands
and thousands of tons of raw
material that finally came to this place
in the form of great girders and vast
lumps of metal, huge framings, hundreds
of miles of stays and rods and straps of
steel, thousands of plates, not one of
which twenty men could lift unaided; millions
of rivets and bolts—all the heaviest
and most sinkable things in the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
And still nothing in the shape of a ship
that could float upon the sea. The seasons
followed each other, the sun rose now
behind the heights of Carrickfergus and
now behind the Copeland Islands; daily
the ships came in from fighting with the
boisterous seas, and the two gray horses
cantered beside them as they slid between
the islands; daily the endless uproar
went on, and the tangle of metal
beneath the cathedral scaffolding grew
denser. A great road of steel, nearly a
quarter of a mile long, was laid at last—a
road so heavy and so enduring that it
might have been built for the triumphal
progress of some giant railway train.
Men said that this roadway was the keel
of a ship; but you could not look at it
and believe them.</p>

<p>The scaffolding grew higher; and as it
grew the iron branches multiplied and
grew with it, higher and higher towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the sky, until it seemed as though man
were rearing a temple which would express
all he knew of grandeur and sublimity,
and all he knew of solidity and
permanence—something that should endure
there, rooted to the soil of Queen’s
Island for ever. The uproar and the
agony increased. In quiet studios and
offices clear brains were busy with drawings
and calculations and subtle elaborate
mathematical processes, sifting and applying
the tabulated results of years of experience.
The drawings came in time to
the place of uproar; were magnified and
subdivided and taken into grimy workshops;
and steam-hammers and steam-saws
smote and ripped at the brute metal,
to shape it in accordance with the shapes
on the paper. And still the ships, big
and little, came nosing in from the high
seas—little dusty colliers from the Tyne,
and battered schooners from the coast,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and timber ships from the Baltic, and
trim mail steamers, and giants of the
ocean creeping in wounded for succour—all
solemnly received by the twin gray
horses and escorted to their stations in the
harbour. But the greatest giant of all
that came in, which dwarfed everything
else visible to the eye, was itself dwarfed
to insignificance by the great cathedral
building on the island.</p>

<p>The seasons passed; the creatures who
wrought and clambered among the iron
branches, and sang their endless song of
labour there, felt the steel chill beneath
the frosts of winter, and burning hot
beneath the sun’s rays in summer, until
at last the skeleton within the scaffolding
began to take a shape, at the sight of
which men held their breaths. It was the
shape of a ship, a ship so monstrous and
unthinkable that it towered high over the
buildings and dwarfed the very mountains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
beside the water. It seemed like some
impious blasphemy that man should
fashion this most monstrous and ponderable
of all his creations into the likeness
of a thing that could float upon the yielding
waters. And still the arms swung
and the hammers rang, the thunder and
din continued, and the gray horses shook
their manes and cantered along beneath
the shadow, and led the little ships in
from the sea and out again as though no
miracle were about to happen.</p>

<p>A little more than its own length of
water lay between the iron forest and the
opposite shore, in which to loose this
tremendous structure from its foundations
and slide it into the sea. The thought
that it should ever be moved from its
place, except by an earthquake, was a
thought that the mind could not conceive,
nor could anyone looking at it accept the
possibility that by any method this vast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
tonnage of metal could be borne upon the
surface of the waters. Yet, like an evil
dream, as it took the shape of a giant
ship, all the properties of a ship began to
appear and increase in hideous exaggeration.
A rudder as big as a giant elm
tree, bosses and bearings of propellers
the size of a windmill—everything was
on a nightmare scale; and underneath
the iron foundations of the cathedral floor
men were laying on concrete beds pavements
of oak and great cradles of timber
and iron, and sliding ways of pitch pine
to support the bulk of the monster when
she was moved, every square inch of the
pavement surface bearing a weight of
more than two tons. Twenty tons of tallow
were spread upon the ways, and hydraulic
rams and triggers built and fixed against
the bulk of the ship so that, when the
moment came, the waters she was to conquer
should thrust her finally from earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>And the time did come. The branching
forest became clothed and thick with
leaves of steel. Within the scaffoldings
now towered the walls of the cathedral,
and what had been a network of girders
and cantilevers and gantries and bridges
became a building with floors, a ship
with decks. The skeleton ribs became
covered with skins of wood, the metal
decks clothed with planks smooth as a
ball-room floor. What had been a building
of iron became a town, with miles of
streets and hundreds of separate houses
and buildings in it. The streets were laid
out; the houses were decorated and furnished
with luxuries such as no palace
ever knew.</p>

<p>And then, while men held their breath,
the whole thing moved, moved bodily,
obedient to the tap of the imprisoned
waters in the ram. There was no christening
ceremony such as celebrates the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
launching of lesser ships. Only the waters
themselves dared to give the impulse that
should set this monster afloat. The waters
touched the cradle, and the cradle moved
on the ways, carrying the ship down towards
the waters. And when the cradle
stopped the ship moved on; slowly at first,
then with a movement that grew quicker
until it increased to the speed of a fast-trotting
horse, touching the waters, dipping
into them, cleaving them, forcing
them asunder in waves and ripples that
fled astonished to the surrounding shores;
finally resting and floating upon them,
while thousands of the pigmy men who
had roosted in the bare iron branches,
who had raised the hideous clamour amid
which the giant was born, greeted their
handiwork, dropped their tools, and raised
their hoarse voices in a cheer.</p>

<p>The miracle had happened. And the
day came when the two gray horses were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
summoned to their greatest task; when,
with necks proudly arched and their white
manes flung higher than ever, they escorted
the <i>Titanic</i> between the islands
out to sea.</p>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t</span> noon on Wednesday, 10th April
1912, the <i>Titanic</i> started from
Southampton on her maiden
voyage. Small enough was her experience
of the sea before that day. Many
hands had handled her; many tugs had
fussed about her, pulling and pushing her
this way and that as she was manœuvred
in the waters of Belfast Lough and taken
out to the entrance to smell the sea. There
she had been swung and her compasses
adjusted. Three or four hours had sufficed
for her trial trip, and she had first
felt her own power in the Irish Sea,
when all her new machinery working
together, at first with a certain reserve
and diffidence, had tested and tried its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
various functions, and she had come down
through St. George’s Channel and round
by the Lizard, and past the Eddystone and
up the Solent to Southampton Water,
feeling a little hustled and strange, no
doubt, but finding this business of ploughing
the seas surprisingly easy after all.
And now, on the day of sailing, amid
the cheers of a crowd unusually vast
even for Southampton Docks, the largest
ship in the world slid away from the
deep-water jetty to begin her sea life in
earnest.</p>

<p>In the first few minutes her giant powers
made themselves felt. As she was slowly
gathering way she passed the liner <i>New
York</i>, another ocean monarch, which was
lying like a rock moored by seven great
hawsers of iron and steel. As the <i>Titanic</i>
passed, some mysterious compelling influence
of the water displaced by her vast
bulk drew the <i>New York</i> towards her;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
snapped one by one the great steel hawsers
and pulled the liner from the quayside as
though she had been a cork. Not until
she was within fifteen feet of the <i>Titanic</i>,
when a collision seemed imminent, did
the ever-present tugs lay hold of her and
haul her back to captivity.</p>

<p>Even to the most experienced traveller
the first few hours on a new ship are very
confusing; in the case of a ship like this,
containing the population of a village,
they are bewildering. So the eight hours
spent by the <i>Titanic</i> in crossing from
Southampton to Cherbourg would be
spent by most of her passengers in taking
their bearings, trying to find their way
about and looking into all the wonders of
which the voyage made them free. There
were luxuries enough in the second class,
and comforts enough in the third to make
the ship a wonder on that account alone;
but it was the first-class passengers, used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
as they were to all the extravagant luxuries
of modern civilized life, on whom the discoveries
of that first day of sun and wind
in the Channel must have come with the
greatest surprise. They had heard the
ship described as a floating hotel; but as
they began to explore her they must have
found that she contained resources of a
perfection unattained by any hotel, and
luxuries of a kind unknown in palaces.
The beauties of French chateaux and of
English country-houses of the great period
had been dexterously combined with that
supreme form of comfort which the modern
English and Americans have raised to the
dignity of a fine art. Such a palace as a
great artist, a great epicure, a great poet
and the most spoilt and pampered woman
in the world might have conjured up from
their imagination in an idle hour was here
materialized and set, not in a fixed landscape
of park and woodland, but on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
dustless road of the sea, with the sunshine
of an English April pouring in on every
side, and the fresh salt airs of the Channel
filling every corner with tonic oxygen.</p>

<p>Catalogues of marvels and mere descriptions
of wonders are tiresome reading, and
produce little effect on the mind; yet if
we are to realize the full significance of
this story of the <i>Titanic</i>, we must begin
as her passengers began, with an impression
of the lavish luxury and beauty which
was the setting of life on board. And we
can do no better than follow in imagination
the footsteps of one ideal voyager as
he must have discovered, piece by piece,
the wonders of this floating pleasure
house.</p>

<p>If he was a wise traveller he would have
climbed to the highest point available as
the ship passed down the Solent, and
that would be the boat-deck, which was
afterwards to be the stage of so tragic a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
drama. At the forward end of it was the
bridge—that sacred area paved with snow-white
gratings and furnished with many
brightly-polished instruments. Here were
telephones to all the vital parts of the
ship, telegraphs to the engine room and
to the fo’c’stle head and after-bridge; revolving
switches for closing the water-tight
doors in case of emergency; speaking-tubes,
electric switches for operating
the foghorns and sirens—all the nerves,
in fact, necessary to convey impulses from
this brain of the ship to her various members.
Behind the bridge on either side
were the doors leading to the officers’
quarters; behind them again, the Marconi
room—a mysterious temple full of glittering
machines of brass, vulcanite, glass,
and platinum, with straggling wires and
rows of switches and fuse boxes, and
a high priest, young, clean-shaven, alert
and intelligent, sitting with a telephone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
cap over his head, sending out or receiving
the whispers of the ether. Behind
this opened the grand staircase, an imposing
sweep of decoration in the Early
English style, with plain and solid panelling
relieved here and there with lovely
specimens of deep and elaborate carving
in the manner of Grinling Gibbons; the
work of the two greatest wood-carvers in
England. Aft of this again the white
pathway of the deck led by the doors
and windows of the gymnasium, where
the athletes might keep in fine condition;
and beyond that the white roof above
ended and the rest was deck-space open
to the sun and the air, and perhaps also
to the smoke and smuts of the four vast
funnels that towered in buff and black
into the sky—each so vast that it would
have served as a tunnel for a railway train.</p>

<p>But the ship has gathered way, and is
sliding along past the Needles, where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
little white lighthouse looks so paltry
beside the towering cliff. The Channel
air is keen, and the bugles are sounding
for lunch; and our traveller goes down
the staircase, noticing perhaps, as he
passes, the great clock with its figures
which symbolize Honour and Glory
crowning Time. Honour and Glory must
have felt just a little restive as, having
crowned one o’clock, they looked down
from Time upon the throng of people
descending the staircase to lunch. There
were a few there who had earned, and
many who had received, the honour and
glory represented by extreme wealth; but
the two figures stooping over the clock
may have felt that Success crowning
Opportunity would have been a symbol
more befitting the first-class passengers
of the <i>Titanic</i>. Perhaps they looked
more kindly as one white-haired old man
passed beneath—W.&nbsp;T. Stead, that untiring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
old warrior and fierce campaigner
in peaceful causes, who in fields where
honour and glory were to be found sought
always for the true and not the false.
There were many kinds of men there—not
every kind, for it is not every man
who can pay from fifty to eight hundred
guineas for a four days’ journey; but
most kinds of men and women who can
afford to do that were represented there.</p>

<p>Our solitary traveller, going down the
winding staircase, does not pause on the
first floor, for that leads forward to private
apartments, and aft to a writing-room
and library; nor on the second or third,
for the entrance-halls there lead to state-rooms;
but on the fourth floor down he
steps out into a reception room extending
to the full width of the ship and of almost
as great a length. Nothing of the sea’s
restrictions or discomforts here! Before
him is an Aubusson tapestry, copied from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
one of the “Chasses de Guise” series of
the National Garde-Meuble; and in this
wide apartment there is a sense, not of
the cramping necessities of the sea, but
of all the leisured and spacious life of the
land. Through this luxurious emptiness
the imposing dignities of the dining-saloon
are reached; and here indeed all the insolent
splendour of the ship is centred. It
was by far the largest room that had ever
floated upon the seas, and by far the
largest room that had ever moved from
one place to another. The seventeenth-century
style of Hatfield and Haddon
Hall had been translated from the sombreness
of oak to the lightness of enamelled
white. Artist-plasterers had moulded the
lovely Jacobean ceiling, artist-stainers had
designed and made the great painted
windows through which the bright sea-sunlight
was filtered; and when the whole
company of three hundred was seated at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the tables it seemed not much more than
half full, since more than half as many
again could find places there without the
least crowding. There, amid the strains
of gay music and the hum of conversation
and the subdued clatter of silver and china
and the low throb of the engines, the gay
company takes its first meal on the
<i>Titanic</i>. And as our traveller sits there
solitary, he remembers that this is not all,
that in another great saloon farther off
another three hundred passengers of the
second-class are also at lunch, and that
on the floor below him another seven
hundred of the third-class, and in various
other places near a thousand of the crew,
are also having their meal. All a little
oppressive to read about, perhaps, but
wonderful to contrive and arrange. It is
what everyone is thinking and talking
about who sits at those luxurious tables,
loaded not with sea-fare, but with dainty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and perishable provisions for which half
the countries of the world have been laid
under tribute.</p>

<p>The music flows on and the smooth
service accomplishes itself; Honour and
Glory, high up under the wrought-iron
dome of the staircase, are crowning another
hour of Time; and our traveller comes up
into the fresh air again in order to assure
himself that he is really at sea. The electric
lift whisks him up four storeys to the
deck again; there all around him are the
blue-gray waters of the Channel surging
in a white commotion past the towering
sides of the ship, spurned by the tremendous
rush and momentum of these fifty
thousand tons through the sea. This
time our traveller stops short of the boat-deck,
and begins to explore the far vaster
B deck which, sheltered throughout its
great length by the boat-deck above, and
free from all impediments, extends like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
vast white roadway on either side of the
central deck. Here the busy deck stewards
are arranging chairs in the places that
will be occupied by them throughout the
voyage. Here, as on the parade of a
fashionable park, people are taking their
walks in the afternoon sunshine.</p>

<p>From the staircase forward the deck
houses are devoted to apartments which
are still by force of habit called cabins,
but which have nothing in fact to distinguish
them from the most luxurious habitations
ashore, except that no dust ever
enters them and that the air is always
fresh from the open spaces of the sea.
They are not for the solitary traveller;
but our friend perhaps is curious and peeps
in through an uncurtained window. There
is a complete habitation with bed-rooms,
sitting-room, bath-room and service-room
complete. They breathe an atmosphere
of more than mechanical luxury, more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
material pleasures. Twin bedsteads, perfect
examples of Empire or Louis Seize,
symbolize the romance to which the most
extravagant luxury in the world is but a
minister. Instead of ports there are windows—windows
that look straight out on
to the blue sea, as might the windows of
a castle on a cliff. Instead of stoves or
radiators there are open grates, where fires
of sea-coal are burning brightly. Every
suite is in a different style, and each and
all are designed and furnished by artists;
and the love and repose of millionaires can
be celebrated in surroundings of Adam or
Hepplewhite, or Louis Quatorze or the
Empire, according to their tastes. And
for the hire of each of these theatres the
millionaire must pay some two hundred
guineas a day, with the privilege of being
quite alone, cut off from the common herd
who are only paying perhaps five-and-twenty
pounds a day, and with the privilege,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
if he chooses, of seeing nothing at
all that has to do with a ship, not even
the sea.</p>

<p>For there is one thing that the designers
of this sea-palace seem to have
forgotten and seem to be a little ashamed
of—and that is the sea itself. There it
lies, an eternal prospect beyond these
curtained windows, by far the most lovely
and wonderful thing visible; but it seems
to be forgotten there. True, there is a
smoke-room at the after extremity of the
deck below this, whose windows look out
into a great verandah sheeted in with glass
from which you cannot help looking upon
the sea. But in order to counteract as
much as possible that austere and lovely
reminder of where we are, trellis-work has
been raised within the glass, and great
rose-trees spread and wander all over it,
reminding you by their crimson blossoms
of the earth and the land, and the scented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
shelter of gardens that are far from the
boisterous stress of the sea. No spray
ever drifts in at these heights, no froth or
spume can ever in the wildest storms beat
upon this verandah. Here, too, as almost
everywhere else on the ship, you can, if
you will, forget the sea.</p>



<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> first afternoon at sea seems
long: every face is strange, and it
seems as though in so vast a crowd
none will ever become familiar, although
one of the miracles of sea-life is the way
in which the blurred crowd resolves itself
into individual units, each of which has
its character and significance. And if we
are really to know and understand and
not merely to hear with our ears the tale
of what happened to the greatest ship in
the world, we must first prepare and soak
our minds in her atmosphere, and take in
imagination that very voyage which began
so happily on this April day. At the end
of the afternoon came the coast of France,
and Cherbourg—a sunset memory of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
long breakwater, a distant cliff crowned
with a white building, a fussing of tugs
and hasty transference of passengers and
mails; and finally the lighthouse showing
a golden star against the sunset, when
the great ship’s head was turned to the
red west, and the muffled and murmuring
song of the engines was taken up again.
Perhaps our traveller, bent upon more
discoveries, dined that night not in the
saloon, but in the restaurant, and, following
the illuminated electric signs that
pointed the way along the numerous
streets and roads of the ship, found his
way aft to the Café-Restaurant; where
instead of stewards were French waiters
and a <i>maître d’hotel</i> from Paris, and all
the perfection of that perfect and expensive
service which condescends to give you
a meal for something under a five-pound
note; where, surrounded by Louis Seize
panelling of fawn-coloured walnut, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
may on this April evening eat your
plovers’ eggs and strawberries, and drink
your 1900 Clicquot, and that in perfect
oblivion of the surrounding sea. Afterwards,
perhaps, a stroll on the deck amid
groups of people, not swathed in pea-jackets
or oilskins, but attired as though
for the opera; and all the time, in an atmosphere
golden with light, and musical
with low-talking voices and the yearning
strains of a waltz, driving five-and-twenty
miles an hour westward, with the black
night and the sea all about us. And then
to bed, not in a bunk in a cabin but in a
bedstead in a quiet room with a telephone
through which to speak to any one of two
thousand people, and a message handed
in before you go to sleep that someone
wrote in New York since you rose from
the dinner-table.</p>

<p>The next morning the scene at Cherbourg
was repeated, with the fair green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
shores of Cork Harbour instead of the
cliffs of France for its setting; and then
quietly, without fuss, in the early afternoon
of Thursday, out round the green
point, beyond the headland, and the great
ship has steadied on her course and on
the long sea-road at last. How worn it is!
How seamed and furrowed and printed
with the track-lines of journeys innumerable;
how changing, and yet how unchanged—the
road that leads to Archangel
or Sicily, to Ceylon or to the frozen
Pole; the old road that leads to the ruined
gateways of Phoenicia, of Venice, of Tyre;
the new road that leads to new lives and
new lands; the dustless road, the long
road that all must travel who in body or
in spirit would really discover a new
world. And travel on it as you may for
tens of thousands of miles, you come
back to it always with the same sense of
expectation, never wholly disappointed;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and always with the same certainty that
you will find at the turn or corner of the
road, either some new thing or the renewal
of something old.</p>

<p>There is no human experience in which
the phenomena of small varieties within
one large monotony are so clearly exemplified
as in a sea-voyage. The dreary
beginnings of docks, of baggage, and
soiled harbour water; the quite hopeless
confusion of strange faces—faces entirely
collective, comprising a mere crowd; the
busy highway of the Channel, sunlit or
dim with mist or rain, or lighted and
bright at night like the main street
of a city; the last outpost, the Lizard,
with its high gray cliffs, green-roofed,
with tiny homesteads perched on the
ridge; or Ushant, that tall monitory
tower upstanding on the melancholy
misty flats; or the solitary Fastnet,
lonely, ultimate and watching—these form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the familiar overture to the subsequent
isolation and vacancy of the long road
itself. There are the same day and night
of disturbance, the vacant places at table,
the prone figures, swathed and motionless
in deck-chairs, the morning of brilliant
sunshine, when the light that streams
into the cabins has a vernal strangeness
and wonder for town-dimmed eyes; the
gradual emergence of new faces and
doubtful staggering back of the demoralized
to the blessed freshness of the upper
air; the tentative formation of groups
and experimental alliances, the rapid disintegration
of these and re-formation on
entirely new lines; and then that miracle
of unending interest and wonder, that the
faces that were only the blurred material
of a crowd begin one by one to emerge
from the background and detach themselves
from the mass, to take on identity,
individuality, character, till what was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
crowd of uninteresting, unidentified humanity
becomes a collection of individual
persons with whom one’s destinies
for the time are strangely and unaccountably
bound up; among whom one may
have acquaintances, friends, or perhaps
enemies; who for the inside of a week
are all one’s world of men and women.</p>

<p>There are few alterative agents so
powerful and sure in their working as
latitude and longitude; and as we slide
across new degrees, habit, association,
custom, and ideas slip one by one imperceptibly
away from us; we come really
into a new world, and if we had no hearts
and no memories we should soon become
different people. But the heart lives its
own life, spinning gossamer threads that
float away astern across time and space,
joining us invisibly to that which made
and fashioned us, and to which we hope
to return.</p>



<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>onderful</span>, even for experienced
travellers, is that first
waking to a day on which there
shall be no sight of the shore, and the
first of several days of isolation in the
world of a ship. There is a quality in the
morning sunshine at sea as it streams
into the ship and is reflected in the white
paint and sparkling water of the bath-rooms,
and in the breeze that blows cool
and pure along the corridors, that is like
nothing else. The company on the <i>Titanic</i>
woke up on Friday morning to begin in
earnest their four days of isolated life.
Our traveller, who has found out so many
things about the ship, has not found out
everything yet; and he continues his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
explorations, with the advantage, perhaps,
of a special permit from the Captain
or Chief Engineer to explore other
quarters of the floating city besides that
in which he lives. Let us, with him, try
to form some general conception of the
internal arrangements of the ship.</p>

<p>The great superstructure of decks amidships
which catches the eye so prominently
in a picture or photograph, was but, in
reality, a small part, although the most
luxurious part, of the vessel. Speaking
roughly, one might describe it as consisting
of three decks, five hundred feet
long, devoted almost exclusively to the
accommodation of first-class passengers,
with the exception of the officers’ quarters
(situated immediately aft of the bridge on
the top deck of all), and the second-class
smoking-room and library, at the after
end of the superstructure on the third and
fourth decks. With these exceptions, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
this great four-storied building were
situated all the most magnificent and
palatial accommodations of the ship.
Immediately beneath it, amidships, in the
steadiest part of the vessel where any
movement would be least felt, was the
first-class dining saloon, with the pantries
and kitchens immediately aft of it. Two
decks below it were the third-class dining
saloons and kitchens; below them again,
separated by a heavy steel deck, were the
boiler-rooms and coal bunkers, resting on
the cellular double bottom of the ship.
Immediately aft of the boiler-rooms came
the two engine-rooms; the forward and
larger one of the two contained the reciprocating
engines which drove the twin
screws, and the after one the turbine
engine for driving the large centre propeller.</p>

<p>Forward and aft of this centre part of
the ship, which in reality occupied about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
two-thirds of her whole length, were two
smaller sections, divided (again one speaks
roughly) between second-class accommodation,
stores and cargo in the stern
section, and third-class berths, crew’s
quarters and cargo in the bow section.
But although the first-class accommodation
was all amidships, and the second-class
all aft, that of the third-class was
scattered about in such blank spaces as
could be found for it. Thus most of the
berths were forward, immediately behind
the fo’c’stle, some were right aft; the
dining-room was amidships, and the
smoke-room in the extreme stern, over
the rudder; and to enjoy a smoke or
game of cards a third-class passenger
who was berthed forward would have to
walk the whole length of the ship and
back again, a walk not far short of half
a mile. This gives one an idea of how
much more the ship resembled a town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
than a house. A third-class passenger
did not walk from his bedroom to his
parlour; he walked from the house where
he lived in the forward part of the ship
to the club a quarter of a mile away where
he was to meet his friends.</p>

<p>If, thinking of the <i>Titanic</i> storming
along westward across the Atlantic, you
could imagine her to be split in half from
bow to stern so that you could look, as
one looks at the section of a hive, upon
all her manifold life thus suddenly laid
bare, you would find in her a microcosm
of civilized society. Up on the top are
the rulers, surrounded by the rich and the
luxurious, enjoying the best of everything;
a little way below them their servants and
parasites, ministering not so much to
their necessities as to their luxuries; lower
down still, at the very base and foundation
of all, the fierce and terrible labour
of the stokeholds, where the black slaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
are shovelling and shovelling as though
for dear life, endlessly pouring coal into
furnaces that devoured it and yet ever demanded
a new supply—horrible labour,
joyless life; and yet the labour that gives
life and movement to the whole ship. Up
above are all the beautiful things, the
pleasant things; down below are the
terrible and necessary things. Up above
are the people who rest and enjoy; down
below the people who sweat and suffer.</p>

<p>Consider too the whirl of life and multitude
of human employments that you
would have found had you peered into
this section of the ship that we are supposing
to have been laid bare. Honour
and Glory, let us say, have just crowned
ten o’clock in the morning beneath the
great dome of glass and iron that covers
the central staircase. Someone has just
come down and posted a notice on the
board—a piece of wireless news of something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that happened in London last night.
In one of the sunny bed-rooms (for our
section lays everything bare) someone is
turning over in bed again and telling a
maid to shut out the sun. Eighty feet
below her the black slaves are working in
a fiery pit; ten feet below them is the
green sea. A business-like-looking group
have just settled down to bridge in the
first-class smoking-room. The sea does
not exist for them, nor the ship; the
roses that bloom upon the trellis-work by
the verandah interest them no more than
the pageant of white clouds which they
could see if they looked out of the wide
windows. Down below the chief steward,
attended by his satellites, is visiting the
stores and getting from the store-keeper
the necessaries for his day’s catering. He
has plenty to draw from. In those cold
chambers behind the engine-room are
gathered provisions which seem almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
inexhaustible for any population; for the
imagination does not properly take in the
meaning of such items as a hundred thousand
pounds of beef, thirty thousand fresh
eggs, fifty tons of potatoes, a thousand
pounds of tea, twelve hundred quarts of
cream. In charge of the chief steward
also, to be checked by him at the end of
each voyage, are the china and glass, the
cutlery and plate of the ship, amounting
in all to some ninety thousand pieces.
But there he is, quietly at work with the
store-keeper; and not far from him, in
another room or series of rooms, another
official dealing with the thousands upon
thousands of pieces of linen for bed and
table with which the town is supplied.</p>

<p>Everything is on a monstrous scale.
The centre anchor, which it took a team
of sixteen great horses to drag on a wooden
trolley, weighs over fifteen tons; its cable
will hold a dead weight of three hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
tons. The very rudder, that mere slender
and almost invisible appendage under the
counter, is eighty feet high and weighs a
hundred tons. The men on the look-out
do not climb up the shrouds and ratlines
in the old sea fashion; the mast is hollow
and contains a stairway; there is a door
in it from which they come out to take
their place in the crow’s nest.</p>

<p>Are you weary of such statistics? They
were among the things on which men
thought with pride on those sunny April
days in the Atlantic. Man can seldom
think of himself apart from his environment,
and the house and place in which
he lives are ever a preoccupation with all
men. From the clerk in his little jerry-built
villa to the king in his castle, what
the house is, what it is built of, how it is
equipped and adorned, are matters of
vital interest. And if that is true of land,
where all the webs of life are connected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and intercrossed, how much more must it
be true when a man sets his house afloat
upon the sea; detaches it from all other
houses and from the world, and literally
commits himself to it. This was the
greatest sea town that had ever been built;
these were the first inhabitants of it;
theirs were the first lives that were lived
in these lovely rooms; this was one of
the greatest companies that had ever been
afloat together within the walls of one
ship. No wonder they were proud; no
wonder they were preoccupied with the
source of their pride.</p>

<p>But things stranger still to the life of
the sea are happening in some of the
hundreds of cells which our giant section-knife
has laid bare. An orchestra is practising
in one of them; in another, some
one is catching live trout from a pond;
Post Office sorters are busy in another
with letters for every quarter of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
western world; in a garage, mechanicians
are cleaning half a dozen motor-cars; the
rippling tones of a piano sound from a
drawing-room where people are quietly
reading in deep velvet armchairs surrounded
by books and hothouse flowers;
in another division people are diving and
swimming in a great bath in water deep
enough to drown a tall man; in another
an energetic game of squash racquets is
in progress; and in great open spaces,
on which it is only surprising that turf is
not laid, people by hundreds are sunning
themselves and breathing the fresh air,
utterly unconscious of all these other
activities on which we have been looking.
For even here, as elsewhere, half of the
world does not know and does not care
how the other half lives.</p>

<p>All this magnitude had been designed
and adapted for the realization of two
chief ends—comfort and stability. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
have perhaps heard enough about the
arrangements for comfort; but the more
vital matter had received no less anxious
attention. Practically all of the space
below the water-line was occupied by the
heaviest things in the ship—the boilers,
the engines, the coal bunkers and the
cargo. And the arrangement of her bulkheads,
those tough steel walls that divide
a ship’s hull into separate compartments,
was such that her designers believed that
no possible accident short of an explosion
in her boilers could sink her. If she
rammed any obstruction head on, her
bows might crumple up, but the steel
walls stretching across her hull—and
there were fifteen of them—would prevent
the damage spreading far enough
aft to sink her. If her broadside was
rammed by another ship, and one or even
two of these compartments pierced, even
then the rest would be sufficient to hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
her up at least for a day or two. These
bulkheads were constructed of heavy sheet
steel, and extended from the very bottom
of the ship to a point well above the
water-line. Necessarily there were openings
in them in order to make possible
communication between the different parts
of the ship. These openings were the size
of an ordinary doorway and fitted with
heavy steel doors—not hinged doors,
but panels, sliding closely in water-tight
grooves on either side of the opening.
There were several ways of closing them;
but once closed they offered a resistance
as solid as that of the bulkheads.</p>

<p>The method of opening and closing
them was one of the many marvels of
modern engineering. The heavy steel
doors were held up above the openings
by a series of friction clutches. Up on
the bridge were switches connected with
powerful electro-magnets at the side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the bulkhead openings. The operation of
the switches caused each magnet to draw
down a heavy weight which instantly released
the friction clutches, so that the
doors would slide down in a second or
two into their places, a gong ringing at
the same time to warn anyone who might
be passing through to get out of the way.
The clutches could also be released by
hand. But if for any reason the electric
machinery should fail, there was a provision
made for closing them automatically
in case the ship should be flooded
with water. Down in the double bottom
of the ship were arranged a series of floats
connected with each set of bulkhead doors.
In the event of water reaching the compartment
below the doors, it would raise
the floats, which, in their turn, would release
the clutches and drop the doors.
These great bulkheads were no new experiment;
they had been tried and proved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
When the White Star liner <i>Suevic</i> was
wrecked a few years ago off the Lizard,
it was decided to divide the part of her
which was floating from the part which
was embedded in the rocks; and she was
cut in two just forward of the main collision
bulkhead, and the larger half of her
towed into port with no other protection
from the sea than this vast steel wall
which, nevertheless, easily kept her afloat.
And numberless other ships have owed
their lives to the resisting power of these
steel bulkheads and the quick operation of
the sliding doors.</p>

<p>As for the enormous weight that made
for the <i>Titanic’s</i> stability, it was, as I
have said, contained chiefly in the boilers,
machinery and coal. The coal bunkers
were like a lining running round the boilers,
not only at the sides of the ship, but
also across her whole breadth, thus increasing
the solidity of the steel bulkheads;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and when it is remembered that her
steam was supplied by twenty-nine boilers,
each of them the size of a large room,
and fired by a hundred and fifty-nine furnaces,
the enormous weight of this part
of the ship may be dimly realized.</p>

<p>There are two lives lived side by side
on such a voyage, the life of the passengers
and the life of the ship. From a
place high up on the boat-deck our traveller
can watch the progress of these two
lives. The passengers play games or
walk about, or sit idling drowsily in
deck chairs, with their eyes straying constantly
from the unheeded book to the
long horizon, or noting the trivial doings
of other idlers. The chatter of their
voices, the sound of their games, the
faint tinkle of music floating up from the
music-room are eloquent of one of these
double lives; there on the bridge is an
expression of the other—the bridge in all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
its spick-and-span sanctities, with the
officers of the watch in their trim uniform,
the stolid quartermaster at the wheel,
and his equally stolid companion of the
watch who dreams his four hours away
on the starboard side of the bridge almost
as motionless as the bright brass binnacles
and standards, and the telegraphs
that point unchangeably down to Full
Ahead....</p>

<p>The Officer of the watch has a sextant
at his eye. One by one the Captain, the
Chief, the Second and the Fourth, all
come silently up and direct their sextants
to the horizon. The quartermaster comes
and touches his cap: “Twelve o’clock,
Sir.” There is silence—a deep sunny
silence, broken only by the low tones of
the Captain to the Chief: “What have
you got?” says the Captain. “Thirty,”
says the Chief, “Twenty-nine,” says the
Third. There is another space of sunny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
silent seconds; the Captain takes down
his sextant. “Make it eight bells,” he
says. Four double strokes resound from
the bridge and are echoed from the fo’c’stle
head; and the great moment of the
day, the moment that means so much, is
over. The officers retire with pencils and
papers and tables of logarithms; the clock
on the staircase is put back, and the day’s
run posted; from the deck float up the
sounds of a waltz and laughing voices;
Time and the world flow on with us again.</p>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or</span> anything that the eye could see
the <i>Titanic</i>, in all her strength and
splendour, was solitary on the ocean.
From the highest of her decks nothing
could be seen but sea and sky, a vast
circle of floor and dome of which, for all
her speed of five-and-twenty miles an hour,
she remained always the centre. But it
was only to the sense of sight that she
seemed thus solitary. The North Atlantic,
waste of waters though it appears, is
really a country crossed and divided by
countless tracks as familiar to the seaman
as though they were roads marked by
trees and milestones. Latitude and longitude,
which to a landsman seem mere
mathematical abstractions, represent to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
seamen thousands and thousands of definite
points which, in their relation to
sun and stars and the measured lapse of
time, are each as familiar and as accessible
as any spot on a main road is to a
landsman. The officer on the bridge may
see nothing through his glasses but clouds
and waves, yet in his mind’s eye he sees
not only his own position on the map,
which he could fix accurately within a
quarter of a mile, but the movements of
dozens of other ships coming or going
along the great highways. Each ship
takes its own road, but it is a road that
passes through a certain known territory;
the great liners all know each other’s
movements and where or when they are
likely to meet. Many of such meetings
are invisible; it is called a meeting at sea
if ships pass twenty or thirty miles away
from each other and far out of sight.</p>

<p>For there are other senses besides that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of sight which now pierce the darkness
and span the waste distances of the ocean.
It is no voiceless solitude through which
the <i>Titanic</i> goes on her way. It is full of
whispers, summonses, questions, narratives;
full of information to the listening
ear. High up on the boat deck the little
white house to which the wires straggle
down from the looped threads between the
mastheads is full of the voices of invisible
ships that are coming and going beyond
the horizon. The wireless impulse is too
delicate to be used to actuate a needle like
that of the ordinary telegraph; a little
voice is given to it, and with this it speaks
to the operator who sits with the telephone
cap strapped over his ears; a whining,
buzzing voice, speaking not in words
but in rhythms, corresponding to the dots
and dashes made on paper, out of which
a whole alphabet has been evolved. And
the wireless is the greatest gossip in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
world. It repeats everything it hears; it
tells the listener everyone else’s business;
it speaks to him of the affairs of other
people as well as his own. It is an ever-present
eavesdropper, and tells you what
other people are saying to one another in
exactly the same voice in which they speak
to you. When it is sending your messages
it shouts, splitting the air with crackling
flashes of forked blue fire; but when it has
anything to say to you it whispers in your
ear in whining, insinuating confidence.
And you must listen attentively and with
a mind concentrated on your own business
if you are to receive from it what concerns
you, and reject what does not; for it is
not always the loudest whisper that is
the most important. The messages come
from near and far, now like the rasp of a
file in your ear, and now in a thread of
sound as fine as the whine of a mosquito;
and if the mosquito voice is the one that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
is speaking to you from far away, you
may often be interrupted by the loud and
empty buzzing of one nearer neighbour
speaking to another and loudly interrupting
the message which concerns you.</p>

<p>Listening to these voices in the Marconi
room of the <i>Titanic</i>, and controlling her
articulation and hearing, were two young
men, little more than boys, but boys of a
rare quality, children of the golden age of
electricity. Educated in an abstruse and
delicate science, and loving the sea for its
largeness and adventure, they had come—Phillips
at the age of twenty-six, and
Bride in the ripe maturity of twenty-one—to
wield for the <i>Titanic</i> the electric
forces of the ether, and to direct her utterance
and hearing on the ocean. And as
they sat there that Friday and Saturday
they must have heard, as was their usual
routine, all the whispers of the ships for
two hundred miles round them, their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
trained faculties almost automatically rejecting
the unessential, receiving and attending
to the essential. They heard talk
of many things, talk in fragments and in
the strange rhythmic language that they
had come to know like a mother tongue;
talk of cargoes, talk of money and business,
of transactions involving thousands
of pounds; trivial talk of the emotions,
greetings and good wishes exchanged on
the high seas; endless figures of latitude
and longitude—for a ship is an eternal
egoist and begins all her communications
by an announcement of Who she is and
Where she is. Ships are chiefly interested
in weather and cargo, and their wireless
talk on their own account is constantly
of these things; but most often of the
weather. One ship may be pursuing her
way under a calm sky and in smooth
waters, while two hundred miles away a
neighbour may be in the middle of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
storm; and so the ships talk to one
another of the weather, and combine their
forces against it, and, by altering course
a little, or rushing ahead, or hanging
back, cheat and dodge those malignant
forces which are ever pursuing them.</p>

<p>But in these April days there was nothing
much to be said about the weather.
The winds and the storms were quiet
here; they were busy perhaps up in
Labrador or furiously raging about Cape
Horn, but they had deserted for the time
the North Atlantic, and all the ships
ploughed steadily on in sunshine and
smooth seas. Here and there, however,
a whisper came to Phillips or Bride about
something which, though not exactly
weather, was as deeply interesting to the
journeying ships—ice. Just a whisper,
nothing more, listened to up there in the
sunny Marconi room, recorded, dealt
with, and forgotten. “I have just come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
through bad field-ice,” whispers one ship;
“April ice very far south,” says another;
and Phillips taps out his “O.K., O.M.,”
which is a kind of cockney Marconi for
“All right, old man.” And many other
messages come and go, of money and
cargoes, and crops and the making of
laws; but just now and then a pin-prick
of reminder between all these other topics
comes the word—<small>ICE</small>.</p>

<p>April ice and April weed are two of
the most lovely products of the North
Atlantic, but they are strangely opposite
in their bearings on human destiny. The
lovely golden April weed that is gathered
all round the west coast of Ireland, and
is burnt for indigo, keeps a whole peasant
population in food and clothing for
the rest of the year; the April ice, which
comes drifting down on the Arctic current
from the glacier slopes of Labrador
or the plateau of North Greenland, keeps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the seafaring population of the North
Atlantic in doubt and anxiety throughout
the spring and summer. Lovely indeed
are some of these icebergs that glitter in
the sun like fairy islands or the pinnacles
of Valhalla; and dreamy and gentle is
their drifting movement as they come
down on the current by Newfoundland
and round Cape Race, where, meeting
the east-going Gulf Stream, they are
gradually melted and lost in the waters of
the Atlantic. Northward in the drift are
often field-ice and vast floes; the great
detached bergs sail farther south into the
steamship tracks, and are what are most
carefully looked for. This April there
was abundance of evidence that the field-ice
had come farther south than usual.
The <i>Empress of Britain</i>, which passed
the <i>Titanic</i> on Friday, reported an immense
quantity of floating ice in the
neighbourhood of Cape Race. When she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
arrived in Liverpool it transpired that,
when three days out from Halifax, Nova
Scotia, she encountered an ice-field, a
hundred miles in extent, with enormous
bergs which appeared to be joined to the
ice-field, forming an immense white line,
broken with peaks and pinnacles on the
horizon. The <i>Carmania</i> and the <i>Nicaragua</i>,
which were going westward ahead
of the <i>Titanic</i>, had both become entangled
in ice, and the <i>Nicaragua</i> had sustained
considerable damage. And day by
day, almost hour by hour, news was
coming in from other ships commenting
on the unusual extent southward of the
ice-field, and on the unusual number of
icebergs which they had encountered. No
doubt many of the passengers on the
<i>Titanic</i> were hoping that they would
meet with some; it is one of the chief
interests of the North Atlantic voyage in
the spring and summer; and nothing is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
more lovely in the bright sunshine of day
than the sight of one of these giant
islands, with its mountain-peaks sparkling
in the sun, and blue waves breaking
on its crystal shores; nothing more impressive
than the thought, as one looks
at it, that high as its glittering towers
and pinnacles may soar towards heaven
there is eight times as great a depth of
ice extending downwards into the dark
sea. It is only at night, or when the
waters are covered with a thick fog produced
by the contact of the ice with the
warmer water, that navigating officers,
peering forward into the mist, know how
dreadful may be the presence of one of
these sheeted monsters, the ghostly highwaymen
of the sea.</p>



<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>nformation</span> like this, however,
only concerned the little group of
executive officers who took their turns
in tramping up and down the white gratings
of the bridge. It was all part of their
routine; it was what they expected to
hear at this time of the year and in this
part of the ocean; there was nothing
specially interesting to them in the gossip
of the wireless voices. Whatever they
heard, we may be sure they did not talk
about it to the passengers. For there is
one paramount rule observed by the
officers of passenger liners—and that is
to make everything as pleasant as possible
for the passengers. If there is any
danger, they are the last to hear of it; if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
anything unpleasant happens on board,
such as an accident or a death, knowledge
of it is kept from as many of them as
possible. Whatever may be happening,
short of an apparent and obvious extremity,
it is the duty of the ship’s company
to help the passenger to believe that he
lives and moves and has his being in a
kind of Paradise, at the doors of which
there are no lurking dangers and in which
happiness and pleasure are the first duties
of every inhabitant.</p>

<p>And who were the people who composed
the population of this journeying town?
Subsequent events made their names
known to us—vast lists of names filling
columns of the newspapers; but to the
majority they are names and nothing else.
Hardly anyone living knew more than a
dozen of them personally; and try as we
may it is very hard to see them, as their
fellow voyagers must have seen them, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
individual human beings with recognizable
faces and characters of their own. Of the
three hundred odd first-class passengers
the majority were Americans—rich and
prosperous people, engaged for the most
part in the simple occupation of buying
things as cheaply as possible, selling them
as dearly as possible, and trying to find
some agreeable way of spending the difference
on themselves. Of the three hundred
odd second-class passengers probably the
majority were English, many of them of
the minor professional classes and many
going either to visit friends or to take up
situations in the western world. But the
thousand odd steerage passengers represented
a kind of Babel of nationalities, all
the world in little, united by nothing except
poverty and the fact that they were
in a transition stage of their existence,
leaving behind them for the most part
a life of failure and hopelessness, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
looking forward to a new life of success
and hope: Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans,
missionaries and heathen,
Russians, Poles, Greeks, Roumanians,
Germans, Italians, Chinese, Finns,
Spaniards, English, and French—with a
strong contingent of Irish, the inevitable
link in that melancholy chain of emigration
that has united Ireland and America
since the Famine. But there were other
differences, besides those of their condition
and geographical distribution on the
ship, that divided its inhabitants. For the
first-class passengers the world was a very
small place, about which many of them
were accustomed to hurry in an important
way in the process of spending and getting
their money, taking an Atlantic liner as
humbler people take a tramcar, without
giving much thought to it or laying
elaborate plans, running backwards and
forwards across the Atlantic and its dangers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
as children run across the road in
front of a motor car. They were going to
America this week; they would probably
come back next week or the week after.
They were the people for whom the
<i>Titanic</i> had specially been designed; it
was for them that all the luxuries had
been contrived, so that in their runnings
backwards and forwards they should not
find the long days tedious or themselves
divorced from the kind of accompaniments
to life which they had come to regard as
necessities.</p>

<p>But for the people in the steerage this
was no hurrying trip between one business
office and another; no hasty holiday
arranged to sandwich ten thousand miles
of ozone as a refresher between two business
engagements. This westward progress
was for them part of the drift of
their lives, loosening them from their
native soil to scatter and distribute them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
over the New World, in the hope that in
fresher soil and less crowded conditions
they would strike new roots and begin a
new life. The road they travelled was for
most of them a road to be travelled once
only, a road they knew they would never
retrace. For them almost exclusively was
reserved that strange sense of looking
down over the stern of the ship into the
boiling commotion of the churned-up
waters, the maelstrom of snow under the
counter merging into the pale green highway
that lay straight behind them to the
horizon, and of knowing that it was a
road that divided them from home, a road
that grew a mile longer with every three
minutes of their storming progress. Other
ships would follow on the road; other
ships would turn and come again, and
drive their way straight back over the
white foam to where, with a sudden
plunging and turning of screws in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
green harbour water of home, the road
had begun. But they who looked back
from the steerage quarters of the <i>Titanic</i>
would not return; and they, alone of all
the passengers on the ship, knew it.</p>

<p>And that is all we can know or imagine
about them; but it is probably more than
most of the fortunate ones on the snowy
upper decks cared to know or imagine. Up
there also there were distinctions; some
of the travellers there, for example, were
so rich that they were conspicuous for
riches, even in a population like this—and
I imagine that the standard of wealth is
higher in the first-class population of an
Atlantic liner than in any other group of
people in the world. There were four men
there who represented between them the
possession of some seventy millions of
money—John Jacob Astor, Isidore Straus,
George D. Widener, and Benjamin Guggenheim
their names; and it was said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
that there were twenty who represented a
fortune of a hundred millions between
them—an interesting, though not an important,
fact. But there were people there
conspicuous for other things than their
wealth. There was William T. Stead who,
without any wealth at all, had in some
respects changed the thought and social
destinies of England; there was Francis
Millet, a painter who had attained to
eminence in America and who had recently
been head of the American Academy in
Rome; there was an eminent motorist,
an eminent master of hounds, an eminent
baseball player, an eminent poloist; and
there was Major Archibald Butt, the
satellite and right-hand man of Presidents,
who had had a typical American career
as newspaper correspondent, secretary,
soldier, diplomatist, aide-de-camp, and
novelist. There was Mr. Ismay, the most
important man on the ship, for as head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of the White Star Line he was practically
her owner. He was accompanying her on
her maiden voyage with no other object
than to find out wherein she was defective,
so that her younger sister might excel
her. He may be said to have accomplished
his purpose; and of all the people who
took this voyage he is probably the only
one who succeeded in what he set out to
do. There was Mr. Andrews, one of the
designers of the <i>Titanic</i>, who had come
to enjoy the triumph of his giant child;
and there were several others also, denizens
of that great forest of iron in Belfast
Lough, who had seen her and known her
when she was a cathedral building within
a scaffolding, the most solid and immovable
thing in their world. These, the
friends and companions of her infancy,
had come too, we may suppose, to admire
her in her moment of success, as the
nurses and humble attendants of some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
beautiful girl will watch in a body her
departure for the triumphs of her first
ball.</p>

<p>Of all this throng I had personal knowledge
of only two; and yet the two happened
to be extremely typical. I knew
John Jacob Astor a few years ago in New
York, when he sometimes seemed like
a polite skeleton in his own gay house;
an able but superficially unprepossessing
man, so rich that it was almost impossible
to know accurately anything about him—a
man, I should say, to whom money
had been nothing but a handicap from
his earliest days. He was typical of this
company because he was so conspicuous
and so unknown; for when a man has
thirty millions of money the world hears
about his doings and possessions endlessly,
but knows little of the man himself.
It is enough to say that there were good
things and bad things credited to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
account, of which the good were much
more unlikely and surprising than the bad.</p>

<p>The other man—and how different!—was
Christopher Head. He was typical
too, typical of that almost anonymous
world that keeps the name of England
liked and respected everywhere. I said
that he was typical because these few
conspicuous names that I have mentioned
represent only one narrow class of mankind;
among the unnamed and the unknown
you may be sure, if you have any
wide experience of collective humanity,
that virtues and qualities far more striking
and far more admirable were included.
Christopher Head was mild and unassuming,
and one of the most attractive
of men, for wherever he went he left a
sense of serenity and security; and he
walked through life with a keen, observant
intelligence. Outside Lloyd’s, of which
great corporation he was a member, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
interests were chiefly artistic, and he used
his interest and knowledge in the best
possible way for the public good when he
was Mayor of Chelsea, and made his influence
felt by imparting some quite new
and much-needed ideals into that civic
office.... But two known faces do not
make a crowd familiar; and nothing will
bring most of us any nearer to the knowledge
of these voyagers than will the
knowledge of what happened to them.</p>

<p>One thing we do know—a small thing
and yet illuminating to our picture. There
were many young people on board, many
newly married, and some, we may be sure,
for whom the voyage represented the gateway
to romance; for no Atlantic liner ever
sailed with a full complement and set down
all its passengers in the emotional state in
which it took them up. The sea is a great
match-maker; and in those long monotonous
hours of solitude many flowers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the heart blossom and many minds and
characters strike out towards each other
in new and undreamed-of sympathy.</p>

<p>Of this we may be as sure as of the
existence of the ship: that there were on
board the <i>Titanic</i> people watching the
slip of moon setting early on those April
nights for whom time and the world
were quite arrested in their course, and
for whom the whole ship and her teeming
activities were but frame and setting for
the perfect moment of their lives; for
whom the thronging multitudes of their
fellow passengers were but a blurred background
against which the colour of their
joy stood sharp and clear. The fields of
foam-flecked blue, sunlit or cloud-shadowed
by day; the starlight on the waters;
the slow and scarcely perceptible swinging
of the ship’s rail against the violet and
spangled sky; the low murmur of voices,
the liquid notes of violins, the trampling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
tune of the engines—to how many others
have not these been the properties of a
magic world; for how many others, as
long as men continue to go in ships upon
the sea, will they not be the symbols of a
joy that is as old as time, and that is found
to be new by every generation! For this
also is one of the gifts of the sea, and one
of the territories through which the long
road passes.</p>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>unday</span> came, with nothing to
mark it except the morning service
in the saloon—a function that by
reason of its novelty, attracts some people
at sea who do not associate it with the
shore. One thing, however, fire or boat
muster, which usually marks Sunday at
sea, and gives it a little variety, did not
for some reason take place. It is one of
the few variants of the monotony of shipboard
life, where anything in the nature
of a spectacle is welcomed; and most
travellers are familiar with the stir caused
by the sudden hoarse blast of the foghorn
and the subsequent patter of feet
and appearance from below of all kinds
of people whose existence the passenger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
had hardly suspected. Stewards, sailors,
firemen, engineers, nurses, bakers,
butchers, cooks, florists, barbers, carpenters,
and stewardesses, ranged in two
immense lines along the boat deck, answer
to their names and are told off, according
to their numbers, to take charge of certain
boats. This muster did not take place on
the <i>Titanic</i>; if it had it would have revealed
to any observant passenger the
fact that the whole crew of nine hundred
would have occupied all the available accommodation
in the boats hanging on the
davits and left no room for any passengers.
For the men who designed and built
the <i>Titanic</i>, who knew the tremendous
strength of the girders and cantilevers
and bulkheads which took the thrust and
pull of every strain that she might undergo,
had thought of boats rather as a
superfluity, dating from the days when
ships were vulnerable, when they sprang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
leaks and might sink in the high seas.
In their pride they had said “the <i>Titanic</i>
cannot spring a leak.” So there was no
boat muster, and the routine occupations
of Sunday went on unvaried and undisturbed.
Only in the Marconi room was
the monotony varied, for something had
gone wrong with the delicate electrical
apparatus, and the wireless voice was
silent; and throughout the morning and
afternoon, for seven hours, Phillips and
Bride were hard at work testing and
searching for the little fault that had cut
them off from the world of voices. And
at last they found it, and the whining and
buzzing began again. But it told them
nothing new; only the same story, whispered
this time from the <i>Californian</i>—the
story of ice.</p>

<p>The day wore on, the dusk fell, lights
one by one sprang up and shone within
the ship; the young moon rose in a cloudless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sky spangled with stars. People remarked
on the loveliness of the night as
they went to dress for dinner, but they
remarked also on its coldness. There was
an unusual chill in the air, and lightly
clad people were glad to draw in to the
big fireplaces in smoke-room or drawing-room
or library, and to keep within the
comfort of the warm and lamplit rooms.
The cold was easily accounted for; it was
the ice season, and the airs that were
blowing down from the north-west carried
with them a breath from the ice-fields. It
was so cold that the decks were pretty
well deserted, and the usual evening concert,
instead of being held on the open
deck, was held in the warmth, under
cover. And gradually people drifted away
to bed, leaving only a few late birds
sitting up reading in the library, or
playing cards in the smoking-rooms, or
following a restaurant dinner-party by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
quiet conversation in the flower-decked
lounge.</p>

<p>The ship had settled down for the night;
half of her company were peacefully
asleep in bed, and many lying down
waiting for sleep to come, when something
happened. What that something
was depended upon what part of the ship
you were in. The first thing to attract
the attention of most of the first-class
passengers was a negative thing—the
cessation of that trembling, continuous
rhythm which had been the undercurrent
of all their waking sensations since the
ship left Queenstown. The engines
stopped. Some wondered, and put their
heads out of their state-room doors,
or even threw a wrap about them and
went out into the corridors to see what
had happened, while others turned over
in bed and composed themselves to
sleep, deciding to wait until the morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to hear what was the cause of the
delay.</p>

<p>Lower down in the ship they heard a
little more. The sudden harsh clash of
the engine-room telegraph bells would
startle those who were near enough to
hear it, especially as it was followed almost
immediately afterwards by the simultaneous
ringing all through the lower
part of the ship of the gongs that gave
warning of the closing of the water-tight
doors. After the engines stopped there
was a moment of stillness; and then the
vibration began again, more insistently
this time, with a certain jumping movement
which to the experienced ear meant
that the engines were being sent full
speed astern; and then they stopped
again, and again there was stillness.</p>

<p>Here and there in the long corridors
amidships a door opened and some one
thrust a head out, asking what was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
matter; here and there a man in pyjamas
and a dressing-gown came out of his
cabin and climbed up the deserted staircase
to have a look at what was going
on; people sitting in the lighted saloons
and smoke-rooms looked at one another
and said: “What was that?” gave or
received some explanation, and resumed
their occupations. A man in his dressing-gown
came into one of the smoking-rooms
where a party was seated at cards, with a
few yawning bystanders looking on before
they turned in. The newcomer wanted
to know what was the matter, whether
they had noticed anything? They had
felt a slight jar, they said, and had seen
an iceberg going by past the windows;
probably the ship had grazed it, but no
damage had been done. And they resumed
their game of bridge. The man
in the dressing-gown left the smoke-room,
and never saw any of the players again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
So little excitement was there in this part
of the ship that the man in the dressing-gown
(his name was Mr. Beezley, an
English schoolmaster, one of the few
who emerges from the crowd with an intact
individuality) went back to his cabin
and lay down on his bed with a book,
waiting for the ship to start again. But
the unnatural stillness, the uncanny peace
even of this great peaceful ship, must
have got a little upon his nerves; and
when he heard people moving about in
the corridors, he got up again, and found
that several people whom the stillness had
wakened from their sleep were wandering
about inquiring what had happened.</p>

<p>But that was all. The half-hour which
followed the stoppage of the ship was a
comparatively quiet half-hour, in which a
few people came out of their cabins indeed,
and collected together in the corridors
and staircases gossiping, speculating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and asking questions as to what
could have happened; but it was not a
time of anxiety, or anything like it.
Nothing could be safer on this quiet
Sunday night than the great ship, warmed
and lighted everywhere, with her thick
carpets and padded armchairs and cushioned
recesses; and if anything could
have added to the sense of peace and
stability, it was that her driving motion
had ceased, and that she lay solid and
motionless-like a rock in the sea, the still
water scarcely lapping against her sides.
And those of her people who had thought
it worth while to get out of bed stood
about in little knots, and asked foolish
questions, and gave foolish answers in
the familiar manner of passengers on shipboard
when the slightest incident occurs
to vary the regular and monotonous
routine.</p>



<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his</span> was one phase of that first
half-hour. Up on the high bridge,
isolated from all the indoor life of
the passengers, there was another phase.
The watches had been relieved at ten
o’clock, when the ship had settled down
for the quietest and least eventful period
of the whole twenty-four hours. The First
Officer, Mr. Murdoch, was in command
of the bridge, and with him was Mr.
Boxhall, the Fourth Officer, and the
usual look-out staff. The moon had set,
and the night was very cold, clear and
starry, except where here and there a
slight haze hung on the surface of the
water. Captain Smith, to whom the night
of the sea was like day, and to whom all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the invisible tracks and roads of the
Atlantic were as familiar as Fleet Street
is to a <i>Daily Telegraph</i> reporter, had
been in the chart room behind the bridge
to plot out the course for the night, and
afterwards had gone to his room to lie
down. Two pairs of sharp eyes were
peering forward from the crow’s nest,
another pair from the nose of the ship on
the fo’c’stle head, and at least three pairs
from the bridge itself, all staring into the
dim night, quartering with busy glances
the area of the black sea in front of them
where the foremast and its wire shrouds
and stays were swinging almost imperceptibly
across the starry sky.</p>

<p>At twenty minutes to twelve the silence
of the night was broken by three sharp
strokes on the gong sounding from the
crow’s nest—a signal for something right
ahead; while almost simultaneously came
a voice through the telephone from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
look-out announcing the presence of ice.
There was a kind of haze in front of the
ship the colour of the sea, but nothing
could be distinguished from the bridge.
Mr. Murdoch’s hand was on the telegraph
immediately, and his voice rapped
out the order to the quartermaster to
starboard the helm. The wheel spun
round, the answering click came up from
the startled engine-room; but before anything
else could happen there was a slight
shock, and a splintering sound from the
bows of the ship as she crashed into
yielding ice. That was followed by a
rubbing, jarring, grinding sensation along
her starboard bilge, and a peak of dark-coloured
ice glided past close alongside.</p>

<p>As the engines stopped in obedience to
the telegraph Mr. Murdoch turned the
switches that closed the water-tight doors.
Captain Smith came running out of the
chart room. “What is it?” he asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
“We have struck ice, Sir.” “Close the
water-tight doors.” “It is already done,
Sir.” Then the Captain took command.
He at once sent a message to the carpenter
to sound the ship and come and
report; the quartermaster went away
with the message, and set the carpenter
to work. Captain Smith now gave a
glance at the commutator, a dial which
shows to what extent the ship is off the
perpendicular, and noticed that she carried
a 5° list to starboard. Coolly following a
routine as exact as that which he would
have observed had he been conning the
ship into dock, he gave a number of
orders in rapid succession, after first consulting
with the Chief Engineer. Then,
having given instructions that the whole
of the available engine-power was to be
turned to pumping the ship, he hurried
aft along the boat-deck to the Marconi
room. Phillips was sitting at his key,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
toiling through routine business; Bride,
who had just got up to relieve him, was
sleepily making preparations to take his
place. The Captain put his head in at the
door.</p>

<p>“We have struck an iceberg,” he said,
“and I am having an inspection made to
tell what it has done for us. Better get
ready to send out a call for assistance, but
don’t send it until I tell you.”</p>

<p>He hurried away again; in a few
minutes he put his head in at the door
again; “Send that call for assistance,”
he said.</p>

<p>“What call shall I send?” asked
Phillips.</p>

<p>“The regulation international call for
help, just that,” said the Captain, and
was gone again.</p>

<p>But in five minutes he came back into
the wireless room, this time apparently
not in such a hurry. “What call are you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
sending?” he asked; and when Phillips
told him “C.Q.D.,” the highly technical
and efficient Bride suggested, laughingly,
that he should send “S.O.S.,” the new
international call for assistance which has
superseded the C.Q.D. “It is the new
call,” said Bride, “and it may be your
last chance to send it!” And they all
three laughed, and then for a moment
chatted about what had happened, while
Phillips tapped out the three longs, three
shorts, and three longs which instantaneously
sent a message of appeal flashing
out far and wide into the dark night.
The Captain, who did not seem seriously
worried or concerned, told them that the
ship had been struck amidships or a little
aft of that.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been happening
down below, everything up here was quiet
and matter-of-fact. It was a disaster, of
course, but everything was working well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
everything had been done; the electric
switches for operating the bulkhead doors
had been used promptly, and had worked
beautifully; the powerful wireless plant
was talking to the ocean, and in a few
hours there would be some other ship
alongside of them. It was rough luck, to
be sure; they had not thought they would
so soon have a chance of proving that the
<i>Titanic</i> was unsinkable.</p>



<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e</span> must now visit in imagination
some other parts of the ship,
parts isolated from the bridge
and the spacious temple of luxury amidships,
and try to understand how the
events of this half hour appeared to the
denizens of the lower quarters of the ship.
The impact that had been scarcely noticed
in the first-class quarters had had much
more effect down below, and especially
forward, where some of the third-class
passengers and some of the crew were
berthed. A ripping, grinding crash
startled all but the heaviest sleepers here
into wakefulness; but it was over so soon
and was succeeded by so peaceful a silence
that no doubt any momentary panic it
might have caused was soon allayed. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of the firemen describing it said: “I was
awakened by a noise, and between sleeping
and waking I thought I was dreaming
that I was on a train that had run off the
lines, and that I was being jolted about.”
He jumped out and went on deck, where
he saw the scattered ice lying about. “Oh,
we have struck an iceberg,” he said,
“that’s nothing; I shall go back and
turn in,” and he actually went back to bed
and slept for half an hour, until he was
turned out to take his station at the boats.</p>

<p>The steerage passengers, who were
berthed right aft, heard nothing and knew
nothing until the news that an accident
had happened began slowly to filter down
to them. But there was no one in authority
to give them any official news, and for
a time they were left to wonder and speculate
as they chose. Forward, however, it
became almost immediately apparent to
certain people that there was something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
grievously wrong; firemen on their way
through the passage along the ship’s bottom
leading between their quarters and
No. 1 stokehold found water coming in,
and rapidly turned back. They were met
on their way up the staircase by an officer
who asked them what they were doing.
They told him. “There’s water coming
into our place, Sir,” they said; and as he
thought they were off duty he did not turn
them back.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrews, a partner in Harland
and Wolff’s, and one of the <i>Titanic’s</i>
designers, had gone quietly down by himself
to investigate the damage, and, great
as was his belief in the giant he had
helped to create, it must have been shaken
when he found the water pouring into
her at the rate of hundreds of tons a
minute. Even his confidence in those
mighty steel walls that stretched one behind
the other in succession along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
whole length of the ship could not have
been proof against the knowledge that
three or four of them had been pierced by
the long rip of the ice-tooth. There was
just a chance that she would hold up
long enough to allow of relief to arrive in
time; but it is certain that from that moment
Mr. Andrews devoted himself to
warning people, and helping to get them
away, so far as he could do so without
creating a panic.</p>

<p>Most of the passengers, remember,
were still asleep during this half hour.
One of the most terrible things possible
at sea is a panic, and Captain Smith was
particularly anxious that no alarm should
be given before or unless it was absolutely
necessary. He heard what Mr. Andrews
had to say, and consulted with the engineer,
and soon found that the whole of
the ship’s bottom was being flooded. There
were other circumstances calculated to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
make the most sanguine ship-master uneasy.
Already, within half an hour, the
<i>Titanic</i> was perceptibly down by the head.
She would remain stationary for five
minutes and then drop six inches or a
foot; remain stationary again, and drop
another foot—a circumstance ominous to
experienced minds, suggesting that some
of the smaller compartments forward were
one by one being flooded, and letting the
water farther and farther into her hull.</p>

<p>Therefore at about twenty-five minutes
past midnight the Captain gave orders for
the passengers to be called and mustered
on the boat deck. All the ship’s crew
had by this time been summoned to their
various stations; and now through all
the carpeted corridors, through the companion-ways
and up and down staircases,
leading to the steerage cabins, an army
of three hundred stewards was hurrying,
knocking loudly on doors, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
shouting up and down the passages,
“All passengers on deck with life-belts
on!” The summons came to many in their
sleep; and to some in the curtained firelight
luxury of their deck state-rooms it
seemed an order so absurd that they
scorned it, and actually went back to bed
again. These, however, were rare exceptions;
for most people there was no mistaking
the urgency of the command, even
though they were slow to understand the
necessity for it. And hurry is a thing
easily communicated; seeing some passengers
hastening out with nothing over
their night clothes but a blanket or a
wrapper, others caught the infection, and
hurried too; and struggling with life-belts,
clumsily attempting to adjust them
over and under a curious assortment of
garments, the passengers of the <i>Titanic</i>
came crowding up on deck, for the first
time fully alarmed.</p>



<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> the people came on deck
it was half-past twelve. The
first-class passengers came
pouring up the two main staircases and
out on to the boat deck—some of them
indignant, many of them curious, some
few of them alarmed. They found there
everything as usual except that the long
deck was not quite level; it tilted downwards
a little towards the bow, and there
was a slight list towards the starboard
side. The stars were shining in the sky
and the sea was perfectly smooth, although
dotted about it here and there were lumps
of dark-coloured ice, almost invisible
against the background of smooth water.
A long line of stewards was forming up
beside the boats on either side—those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
solid white boats, stretching far aft in
two long lines, that became suddenly invested
with practical interest. Officers
were shouting orders, seamen were busy
clearing up the coils of rope attached to
the davit tackles, fitting the iron handles
to the winches by which the davits themselves
were canted over from the inward
position over the deck to the outward
position over the ship’s side. Almost at
the same time a rush of people began
from the steerage quarters, swarming up
stairways and ladders to reach this high
deck hitherto sacred to the first-class passengers.
At first they were held back by
a cordon of stewards, but some broke
through and others were allowed through,
so that presently a large proportion of
the ship’s company was crowding about
the boat deck and the one immediately
below it.</p>

<p>Then the business of clearing, filling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and lowering the boats was begun—a
business quickly described, but occupying
a good deal of time in the transaction.
Mr. Murdoch, the Chief Officer, ordered
the crews to the boats; and with some
confusion different parties of stewards and
sailors disentangled themselves from the
throng and stood in their positions by each
of the sixteen boats. Every member of
the crew, when he signs on for a voyage in
a big passenger ship, is given a number
denoting which boat’s crew he belongs
to. If there has been boat drill, every
man knows and remembers his number;
if, as in the case of the <i>Titanic</i>, there
has been no boat drill, some of the men
remember their numbers and some do
not, the result being a certain amount of
confusion. But at last a certain number
of men were allotted to each boat, and
began the business of hoisting them out.</p>

<p>First of all the covers had to be taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
off and the heavy masts and sails lifted
out of them. Ship’s boats appear very
small things when one sees a line of them
swinging high up on deck; but, as a
matter of fact, they are extremely heavy,
each of them the size of a small sailing
yacht. Everything on the <i>Titanic</i> having
been newly painted, everything was stiff
and difficult to move. The lashings of
the heavy canvas covers were like wire,
and the covers themselves like great
boards; the new ropes ran stiffly in the
new gear. At last a boat was cleared and
the order given, “Women and children
first.” The officers had revolvers in their
hands ready to prevent a rush; but there
was no rush. There was a certain amount
of laughter. No one wanted to be the
first to get into the boat and leave the
ship. “Come on,” cried the officers.
There was a pause, followed by the brief
command, “Put them in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>”</p>

<p>The crew seized the nearest women and
pushed or lifted them over the rail into
the first boat, which was now hanging
over the side level with the deck. But
they were very unwilling to go. The
boat, which looked big and solid on the
deck, now hung dizzily seventy-five feet
over the dark water; it seemed a far from
attractive prospect to get into it and go
out on to the cold sea, especially as everyone
was convinced that it was a merely
formal precaution which was being taken,
and that the people in the boats would
merely be rowed off a little way and kept
shivering on the cold sea for a time and
then brought back to the ship when it
was found that the danger was past. For,
walking about the deck, people remembered
all the things that they had been
thinking and saying since first they had
seen the <i>Titanic</i>; and what was the use of
travelling by an unsinkable ship if, at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
first alarm of danger, one had to leave her
and row out on the icy water? Obviously
it was only the old habit of the sea asserting
itself, and Captain Smith, who had
hitherto been such a favourite, was beginning
to be regarded as something of a
nuisance with his ridiculous precautions.</p>

<p>The boats swung and swayed in the
davits; even the calm sea, now that they
looked at it more closely, was seen to be
not absolutely like a millpond, but to have
a certain movement on its surface which,
although utterly helpless to move the
huge bulk of the <i>Titanic</i>, against whose
sides it lapped, as ineffectually as against
the walls of a dock, was enough to impart
a swinging movement to the small
boats. But at last, what with coercion
and persuasion, a boat was half filled
with women. One of the things they
liked least was leaving their husbands;
they felt that they were being sacrificed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
needlessly to over-elaborate precautions,
and it was hard to leave the men standing
comfortably on the firm deck, sheltered
and in a flood of warm yellow light,
and in the safety of the great solid ship
that lay as still as a rock, while they had
to go out, half-clad and shivering, on the
icy waters.</p>

<p>But the inexorable movements of the
crew continued. The pulleys squealed
in the sheaves, the new ropes were paid
out; and jerking downwards, a foot or
two at a time, the first boat dropped down
towards the water, past storey after storey
of the great structure, past rows and rows
of lighted portholes, until at last, by
strange unknown regions of the ship’s
side, where cataracts and waterfalls were
rushing into the sea, it rested on the
waves. The blocks were unhooked, the
heavy ash oars were shipped, and the
boat headed away into the darkness. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
then, and not till then, those in the boat
realized that something was seriously
wrong with the <i>Titanic</i>. Instead of the
trim level appearance which she presented
on the picture postcards or photographs,
she had an ungraceful slant downwards
to the bows—a heavy helpless appearance
like some wounded monster that is being
overcome by the waters. And even while
they looked, they could see that the bow
was sinking lower.</p>

<p>After the first boat had got away, there
was less difficulty about the others. The
order, “Women and children first,” was
rigidly enforced by the officers; but it
was necessary to have men in the boats
to handle them, and a number of stewards,
and many grimy figures of stokers who
had mysteriously appeared from below
were put into them to man them. Once
the tide of people began to set into the
boats and away from the ship, there came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a certain anxiety to join them and not to
be left behind. Here and there indeed
there was over-anxiety, which had to be
roughly checked. One band of Italians
from the steerage, who had good reason
to know that something was wrong, tried
to rush one of the boats, and had to be
kept back by force, an officer firing a
couple of shots with his pistol; they desisted,
and were hauled back ignominiously
by the legs. In their place some of
the crew and the passengers who were
helping lifted in a number of Italian
women limp with fright.</p>

<p>And still everyone was walking about
and saying that the ship was unsinkable.
There was a certain subdued excitement,
natural to those who feel that they are
taking part in a rather thrilling adventure
which will give them importance in
the eyes of people at home when they
relate it. There was as yet no call for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
heroism, because, among the first-class
passengers certainly, the majority believed
that the safest as well as the most comfortable
place was the ship. But it was
painful for husbands and wives to be
separated, and the wives sent out to brave
the discomforts of the open boats while
the husbands remained on the dry and
comfortable ship.</p>

<p>The steerage people knew better and
feared more. Life had not taught them,
as it had taught some of those first-class
passengers, that the world was an organization
specially designed for their comfort
and security; they had not come to
believe that the crude and ugly and elementary
catastrophes of fate would not
attack them. On the contrary, most of
them knew destiny as a thing to fear, and
made haste to flee from it. Many of
them, moreover, had been sleeping low
down in the forward part of the ship;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
they had heard strange noises, had seen
water washing about where no water
should be, and they were frightened.
There was, however, no discrimination
between classes in putting the women
into the boats. The woman with a tattered
shawl over her head, the woman
with a sable coat over her nightdress, the
woman clasping a baby, and the woman
clutching a packet of trinkets had all an
equal chance; side by side they were
handed on to the harsh and uncomfortable
thwarts of the lifeboats; the wife of the
millionaire sat cheek by jowl with a dusty
stoker and a Russian emigrant, and the
spoiled woman of the world found some
poor foreigner’s baby thrown into her lap
as the boat was lowered.</p>

<p>By this time the women and children
had all been mustered on the second or
A deck; the men were supposed to remain
up on the boat deck while the boats were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
being lowered to the level of the women,
where sections of the rail had been cleared
away for them to embark more easily;
but this rule, like all the other rules, was
not rigidly observed. The crew was not
trained enough to discipline and coerce the
passengers. How could they be? They
were trained to serve them, to be obsequious
and obliging; it would have been too
much to expect that they should suddenly
take command and order them about.</p>

<p>There were many minor adventures and
even accidents. One woman had both her
legs broken in getting into the boat. The
mere business of being lowered in a boat
through seventy feet of darkness was in
itself productive of more than one exciting
incident. The falls of the first boat
jammed when she was four feet from the
water, and she had to be dropped into it
with a splash. And there was one very
curious incident which happened to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
boat in which Mr. Beezley, the English
schoolmaster already referred to, had been
allotted a place as a helper. “As the
boat began to descend,” he said, “two
ladies were pushed hurriedly through the
crowd on B deck, and a baby ten months
old was passed down after them. Then
down we went, the crew shouting out
directions to those lowering us. ‘Level,’
‘Aft,’ ‘Stern,’ ‘Both together!’ until we
were some ten feet from the water. Here
occurred the only anxious moment we
had during the whole of our experience
from the time of our leaving the deck to
our reaching the <i>Carpathia</i>.</p>

<p>“Immediately below our boat was the
exhaust of the condensers, and a huge
stream of water was pouring all the time
from the ship’s side just above the water-line.
It was plain that we ought to be
smart away from it if we were to escape
swamping when we touched the water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
We had no officers on board, and no petty
officer or member of the crew to take
charge, so one of the stokers shouted,
‘Some one find the pin which releases
the boat from the ropes and pull it up!’
No one knew where it was. We felt as
well as we could on the floor, and along
the sides, but found nothing. It was
difficult to move among so many people.
We had sixty or seventy on board. Down
we went, and presently we floated with
our ropes still holding us, and the stream
of water from the exhaust washing us
away from the side of the vessel, while
the swell of the sea urged us back against
the side again.</p>

<p>“The result of all these forces was
that we were carried parallel to the ship’s
side, and directly under boat No. 14,
which had filled rapidly with men, and
was coming down on us in a way that
threatened to submerge our boat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Stop lowering 14,’ our crew shouted,
and the crew of No. 14, now only 20 feet
above, cried out the same. The distance
to the top, however, was some 70 feet, and
the creaking of the pulleys must have
deadened all sound to those above, for
down she came, 15 feet, 10 feet, 5 feet, and
a stoker and I reached up and touched the
bottom of the swinging boat above our
heads. The next drop would have brought
her on our heads. Just before she dropped
another stoker sprang to the ropes with
his knife open in his hand. ‘One,’ I
heard him say, and then ‘Two,’ as the
knife cut through the pulley rope.</p>

<p>“‘The next moment the exhaust stream
carried us clear, while boat No. 14 dropped
into the water, taking the space we had
occupied a moment before. Our gunwales
were almost touching. We drifted away
easily, and when our oars were got out,
we headed directly away from the ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>’”</p>

<p>But although there was no sense of
danger, there were some painful partings
on the deck where the women were embarked;
for you must think of this scene
as going on for at least an hour amid a
confusion of people pressing about, trying
to find their friends, asking for information,
listening to some new rumour, trying
to decide whether they should or
should not go in the boats, to a constant
accompaniment of shouted orders, the
roar of escaping steam, the squeal and
whine of the ropes and pulleys, and the
gay music of the band, which Captain
Smith had ordered to play during the
embarkation. Every now and then a
woman would be forced away from her
husband; every now and then a husband,
having got into a boat with his wife,
would be made to get out of it again. If
it was hard for the wives to go, it was
harder for the husbands to see them go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to such certain discomfort and in such
strange company. Colonel Astor, whose
young wife was in a delicate state of
health, had got into the boat with her to
look after her; and no wonder. But he
was ordered out again and came at once,
no doubt feeling bitterly, poor soul, that
he would have given many of his millions
to be able to go honourably with her.
But he stepped back without a word of
remonstrance and gave her good-bye with
a cheery message, promising to meet her
in New York. And if that happened to
him, we may be sure it was happening
over and over again in other boats. There
were women who flatly refused to leave
their husbands and chose to stay with
them and risk whatever fate might be in
store for them, although at that time most
of the people did not really believe that
there was much danger. Yet here and
there there were incidents both touching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and heroic. When it came to the turn of
Mrs. Isidore Straus, the wife of a Jewish
millionaire, she took her seat but got back
out of the boat when she found her husband
was not coming. They were both old
people, and on two separate occasions an
Englishman who knew her tried to persuade
her to get into a boat, but she
would not leave her husband. The second
time the boat was not full and he went to
Mr. Straus and said: “Do go with your
wife. Nobody can object to an old gentleman
like you going. There is plenty of
room in the boat.” The old gentleman
thanked him calmly and said: “I won’t
go before the other men.” And Mrs. Straus
got out and, going up to him, said: “We
have been together for forty years and we
will not separate now.” And she remained
by his side until that happened to them
which happened to the rest.</p>



<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e</span> must now go back to the
Marconi room on the upper
deck where, ten minutes after
the collision, Captain Smith had left the
operators with orders to send out a call
for assistance. From this Marconi room
we get a strange but vivid aspect of the
situation; for Bride, the surviving operator,
who afterwards told the story so
graphically to the <i>New York Times</i>,
practically never left the room until he
left it to jump into the sea, and his knowledge
of what was going on was the vivid,
partial knowledge of a man who was
closely occupied with his own duties and
only knew of other happenings in so far
as they affected his own doings. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
had been working, you will remember,
almost all of that Sunday at locating and
replacing a burnt-out terminal, and were
both very tired. Phillips was taking the
night shift of duty, but he told Bride to
go to bed early and get up and relieve him
as soon as he had had a little sleep, as
Phillips himself was quite worn out with his
day’s work. Bride went to sleep in the cabin
which opened into the operating-room.</p>

<p>He slept some time, and when he woke
he heard Phillips still at work. He could
read the rhythmic buzzing sounds as easily
as you or I can read print. He could hear
that Phillips was talking to Cape Race,
sending dull uninteresting traffic matter;
and he was about to sink off to sleep
again when he remembered how tired
Phillips must be, and decided that he
would get up and relieve him for a spell.
He never felt the shock, or saw anything,
or had any other notification of anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
unusual except no doubt the ringing of
the telegraph bells and cessation of the
beat of the engines. It was a few minutes
afterwards that, as we have seen, the
Captain put his head in at the door and
told them to get ready to send a call, returning
ten minutes later to tell them to
send it.</p>

<p>The two operators were rather amused
than otherwise at having to send out the
S.O.S.; it was a pleasant change from
relaying traffic matter. “We said lots of
funny things to each other in the next
few minutes,” said Bride. Phillips went
stolidly on, firmly hammering out his
“S.O.S., S.O.S.,” sometimes varying it
with “C.Q.D.” for the benefit of such
operators as might not be on the alert for
the new call. For several minutes there
was no reply; then the whining voice at
Phillips’ ear began to answer. Some one
had heard. They had picked up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
steamer <i>Frankfurt</i>, and they gave her the
position and told her that the <i>Titanic</i> had
struck an iceberg and needed assistance.
There was another pause and, in their
minds’ eye, the wireless men could see
the <i>Frankfurt’s</i> operator miles and miles
away across the dark night going along
from his cabin and rousing the <i>Frankfurt’s</i>
Captain and giving his message
and coming back to the instrument, when
again the whining voice began asking for
more news.</p>

<p>They were learning facts up here in the
Marconi room. They knew that the
<i>Titanic</i> was taking in water, and they
knew that she was sinking by the head;
and what they knew they flashed out into
the night for the benefit of all who had
ears to hear. They knew that there were
many ships in their vicinity; but they
knew also that hardly any of them carried
more than one operator, and that even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Marconi operators earning £4 a month
must go to bed and sleep sometimes, and
that it was a mere chance if their call was
heard. But presently the Cunard liner
<i>Carpathia</i> answered and told them her
position, from which it appeared that she
was about seventy miles away. The <i>Carpathia</i>,
which was heading towards the
Mediterranean, told them she had altered
her course and was heading full steam to
their assistance. The <i>Carpathia’s</i> voice
was much fainter than the <i>Frankfurt’s</i>,
from which Phillips assumed that the
<i>Frankfurt</i> was the nearer ship; but there
was a certain lack of promptitude on
board the <i>Frankfurt</i> which made Phillips
impatient. While he was still sending
out the call for help, after the <i>Frankfurt</i>
had answered it, she interrupted him
again, asking what was the matter. They
told Captain Smith, who said, “That fellow
is a fool,” an opinion which Phillips<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and Bride not only shared, but which they
even found time to communicate to the
operator on the <i>Frankfurt</i>. By this time
the <i>Olympic</i> had also answered her twin
sister’s cry for help, but she was far away,
more than three hundred miles; and although
she too turned and began to race
towards the spot where the <i>Titanic</i> was
lying so quietly, it was felt that the
honours of salving her passengers would
go to the <i>Carpathia</i>. The foolish <i>Frankfurt</i>
operator still occasionally interrupted
with a question, and he was finally told,
with such brusqueness as the wireless is
capable of, to keep away from his instrument
and not interfere with the serious
conversations of the <i>Titanic</i> and <i>Carpathia</i>.</p>

<p>Then Bride took Phillips’s place at the
instrument and succeeded in getting a
whisper from the <i>Baltic</i>, and gradually,
over hundreds of miles of ocean, the invisible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
ether told the ships that their giant
sister was in distress. The time passed
quickly with these urgent conversations
on which so much might depend, and
hour by hour and minute by minute the
water was creeping up the steep sides of
the ship. Once the Captain looked in and
told them that the engine-rooms were
taking in water and that the dynamos
might not last much longer. That information
was also sent to the <i>Carpathia</i>, who
by this time could tell them that she had
turned towards them with every furnace
going at full blast, and was hurrying forward
at the rate of eighteen knots instead
of her usual fifteen. It now became a
question how long the storage plant would
continue to supply current. Phillips went
out on deck and looked round. “The
water was pretty close up to the boat deck.
There was a great scramble aft, and how
poor Phillips worked through it I don’t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
know. He was a brave man. I learnt to
love him that night, and I suddenly felt
for him a great reverence, to see him
standing there sticking to his work while
everybody else was raging about. While
I live I shall never forget the work Phillips
did for that last awful fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>Bride felt that it was time to look about
and see if there was no chance of saving
himself. He knew that by this time all
the boats had gone. He could see, by
looking over the side, that the water was
far nearer than it had yet been, and that
the fo’c’s’le decks, which of course were
much lower than the superstructure on
which the Marconi cabin was situated,
were already awash. He remembered
that there was a lifebelt for every member
of the crew and that his own was under
his bunk; and he went and put it on.
And then, thinking how cold the water
would be, he went back and put his boots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
on, and an extra coat. Phillips was still
standing at the key, talking to the <i>Olympic</i>
now and telling her the tragic and
shameful news that her twin sister, the
unsinkable, was sinking by the head and
was pretty near her end. While Phillips
was sending this message Bride strapped
a lifebelt about him and put on his overcoat.
Then, at Phillips’s suggestion, Bride
went out to see if there was anything left
in the shape of a boat by which they could
get away. He saw some men struggling
helplessly with a collapsible boat which
they were trying to lower down on to the
deck. Bride gave them a hand and then,
although it was the last boat left, he
resolutely turned his back on it and went
back to Phillips. At that moment for the
last time, the Captain looked in to give
them their release.</p>

<p>“Men, you have done your full duty,
you can do no more. Abandon your cabin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
now; it is every man for himself; you look
out for yourselves. I release you. That’s
the way of it at this kind of time; every
man for himself.”</p>

<p>Then happened one of the strangest
incidents of that strange hour. I can only
give it in Bride’s own words:</p>

<p>“Phillips clung on, sending, sending.
He clung on for about ten minutes,
or maybe fifteen minutes, after the Captain
released him. The water was then
coming into our cabin.</p>

<p>“While he worked something happened
I hate to tell about. I was back in my
room getting Phillips’s money for him,
and as I looked out of the door I saw a
stoker, or somebody from below decks,
leaning over Phillips from behind. Phillips
was too busy to notice what the man
was doing, but he was slipping the lifebelt
off Phillips’s back. He was a big
man, too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“As you can see, I’m very small. I
don’t know what it was I got hold of, but
I remembered in a flash the way Phillips
had clung on; how I had to fix that lifebelt
in place, because he was too busy to
do it.</p>

<p>“I knew that man from below decks
had his own lifebelt, and should have
known where to get it. I suddenly felt
a passion not to let that man die a decent
sailor’s death. I wished he might have
stretched a rope or walked a plank. I
did my duty. I hope I finished him, but
I don’t know.</p>

<p>“We left him on the cabin floor of the
wireless room, and he wasn’t moving.”</p>

<p>Phillips left the cabin, running aft, and
Bride never saw him alive again. He
himself came out and found the water
covering the bridge and coming aft over
the boat deck.</p>



<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> is one other separate point
of view from which we may look
at the ship during this fateful hour
before all points of view become merged
in one common experience. Mr. Boxhall,
the Fourth Officer, who had been on the
bridge at the moment of the impact, had
been busy sending up rockets and signals
in the effort to attract the attention of a
ship whose lights could be seen some ten
miles away; a mysterious ship which cannot
be traced, but whose lights appear to
have been seen by many independent witnesses
on the <i>Titanic</i>. So sure was he
of her position that Mr. Boxhall spent
almost all his time on the bridge signalling
to her with rockets and flashes; but no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
answer was received. He had, however,
also been on a rapid tour of inspection of
the ship immediately after she had struck.
He went down to the steerage quarters
forward and aft, and he was also down
in the deep forward compartment where
the Post Office men were working with
the mails, and he had at that time found
nothing wrong, and his information contributed
much to the sense of security that
was spread amongst the passengers.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitman, the Third Officer, was in
his bunk at the time of the collision, having
been on duty on the bridge from six
to eight, when the Captain had also been
on the bridge. There had been talk of ice
among the officers on Sunday, and they
had expected to meet with it just before
midnight, at the very time, in fact, when
they had met with it. But very little ice had
been seen, and the speed of the ship had
not been reduced. Mr. Pitman says that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
when he awoke he heard a sound which
seemed to him to be the sound of the ship
coming to anchor. He was not actually
awake then, but he had the sensation of
the ship halting, and heard a sound like
that of chains whirling round the windlass
and running through the hawseholes into
the water. He lay in bed for three or four
minutes wondering in a sleepy sort of way
where they could have anchored. Then,
becoming more awake, he got up, and
without dressing went out on deck; he
saw nothing remarkable, but he went
back and dressed, suspecting that something
was the matter. While he was
dressing Mr. Boxhall looked in and said:
“We have struck an iceberg, old man;
hurry up!”</p>

<p>He also went down below to make an
inspection and find out what damage had
been done. He went to the forward well
deck, where ice was lying, and into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fo’c’s’le, but found nothing wrong there.
The actual damage was farther aft, and
at that time the water had not come into
the bows of the ship. As he was going
back he met a number of firemen coming
up the gangway with their bags of clothing;
they told him that water was coming
into their place. They were firemen off
duty, who afterwards were up on the boat
deck helping to man the boats. Then
Mr. Pitman went down lower into the
ship and looked into No. 1 hatch, where
he could plainly see water. All this took
time; and when he came back he found
that the men were beginning to get the
boats ready, a task at which he helped
under Mr. Murdoch’s orders. Presently
Mr. Murdoch ordered him to take command
of a boat and hang about aft of the
gangway. Pitman had very little relish
for leaving the ship at that time, and in
spite of the fact that she was taking in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
water, every one was convinced that the
<i>Titanic</i> was a much safer place than the
open sea. He had about forty passengers
and six of the crew in his boat, and as it
was about to be lowered, Mr. Murdoch
leant over to him and shook him heartily
by the hand: “Good-bye, old man, and
good luck,” he said, in tones which rather
surprised Pitman, for they seemed to imply
that the good-bye might be for a long
time. His boat was lowered down into
the water, unhooked, and shoved off, and
joined the gradually increasing fleet of
other boats that were cruising about in
the starlight.</p>

<p>There was one man walking about that
upper deck whose point of view was quite
different from that of anyone else. Mr.
Bruce Ismay, like so many others, was
awakened from sleep by the stopping of
the engines; like so many others, also,
he lay still for a few moments, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
got up and went into the passage-way,
where he met a steward and asked him
what was the matter. The steward knew
nothing, and Mr. Ismay went back to
his state-room, put on a dressing-gown
and slippers, and went up to the bridge,
where he saw the Captain. “What has
happened?” he asked. “We have struck
ice,” was the answer. “Is the injury
serious?” “I think so,” said the Captain.
Then Mr. Ismay came down in search of
the Chief Engineer, whom he met coming
up to the bridge; he asked him the same
question, and he also said he thought the
injury serious. He understood from them
that the ship was certainly in danger, but
that there was hope that if the pumps
could be kept going there would be no
difficulty in keeping her afloat quite long
enough for help to come and for the passengers
to be taken off. Whatever was
to be the result, it was a terrible moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
for Mr. Ismay, a terrible blow to the
pride and record of the Company, that
this, their greatest and most invulnerable
ship, should be at least disabled, and
possibly lost, on her maiden voyage. But
like a sensible man, he did not stand
wringing his hands at the inevitable; he
did what he could to reassure the passengers,
repeating, perhaps with a slight
quaver of doubt in his voice, the old
word—unsinkable. When the boats began
to be launched he went and tried to
help, apparently in his anxiety getting
rather in the way. In this endeavour he
encountered the wrath of Mr. Lowe, the
Fifth Officer, who was superintending
the launching of boat No. 5. Mr. Lowe
did not know the identity of the nervous,
excited figure standing by the davits, nor
recognize the voice which kept saying
nervously, “Lower away! lower away!”
and it was therefore with no misgivings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
that he ordered him away from the boat,
saying brusquely, “If you will kindly
get to hell out of this perhaps I’ll be able
to do something!”—a trifling incident,
but evidence that Mr. Ismay made no use
of his position for his own personal ends.
He said nothing, and went away to another
boat, where he succeeded in being
more useful, and it was not till afterwards
that an awe-stricken steward told
the Fifth Officer who it was that he had
chased away with such language. But
after that Mr. Ismay was among the
foremost in helping to sort out the women
and children and get them expeditiously
packed into the boats, with a burden of
misery and responsibility on his heart that
we cannot measure.</p>

<p>One can imagine a great bustle and
excitement while the boats were being
sent away; but when they had all gone,
and there was nothing more to be done,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
those who were left began to look about
them and realize their position. There
was no doubt about it, the <i>Titanic</i> was
sinking, not with any plunging or violent
movement, but steadily settling down,
as a rock seems to settle into the water
when the tide rises about it.</p>

<p>Down in the engine-room and stokeholds,
in conditions which can hardly be
imagined by the ordinary landsman, men
were still working with a grim and stoic
heroism. The forward stokeholds had
been flooded probably an hour after the
collision; but it is practically certain that
the bulkheads forward of No. 5 held until
the last. The doors in those aft of No. 4
had been opened by hand after they had
been closed from the bridge, in order to
facilitate the passage of the engineering
staff about their business; and they remained
open, and the principal bulkhead
protecting the main engine-room, held
until the last. Water thus found its way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
into some compartments, and gradually
rose; but long after those in charge had
given up all hope of saving the ship,
the stokehold watch were kept hard at
work drawing the fires from under the
boilers, so that when the water reached
them there should be no steam. The
duty of the engine-room staff was to keep
the pumps going as long as possible and
to run the dynamos that supplied the
current for the light and the Marconi
installation. This they did, as the black
water rose stage by stage upon them. At
least twenty minutes before the ship sank
the machinery must have been flooded,
and the current for the lights and the
wireless supplied from the storage plant.
No member of the engine-room staff was
ever seen alive again, but, when the water
finally flooded the stokeholds, the watch
were released and told to get up and
save themselves if they could.</p>

<p>And up on deck a chilly conviction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
doom was slowly but certainly taking the
place of that bland confidence in the unsinkable
ship in which the previous hour
had been lightly passed. That confidence
had been dreadfully overdone, so much so
that the stewards had found the greatest
difficulty in persuading the passengers to
dress themselves and come up on deck,
and some who had done so had returned
to their state-rooms and locked themselves
in. The last twenty minutes, however,
must have shown everyone on deck
that there was not a chance left. On a
ship as vast and solid as the <i>Titanic</i> there
is no sensation of actual sinking or settling.
She still seemed as immovable as
ever, but the water was climbing higher
and higher up her black sides. The
sensation was not that of the ship sinking,
but of the water rising about her.
And the last picture we have of her, while
still visible, still a firm refuge amid the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
waters, is of the band still playing and a
throng of people looking out from the
lamplit upper decks after the disappearing
boats, bracing themselves as best they
might for the terrible plunge and shock
which they knew was coming. Here and
there men who were determined still to
make a fight for life climbed over the rail
and jumped over; it was not a seventy
foot drop now—perhaps under twenty,
but it was a formidable jump. Some were
stunned, and some were drowned at once
before the eyes of those who waited; and
the dull splashes they made were probably
the first visible demonstration of the
death that was coming. Duties were still
being performed; an old deck steward,
who had charge of the chairs, was busily
continuing to work, adapting his duties
to the emergency that had arisen and
lashing chairs together. In this he was
helped by Mr. Andrews, who was last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
seen engaged on this strangely ironic task
of throwing chairs overboard—frail rafts
thrown upon the waters that might or
might not avail some struggling soul
when the moment should arrive, and the
great ship of his designing float no longer.
Throughout he had been untiring in his
efforts to help and hearten people; but in
this the last vision of him, there is something
not far short of the sublime.</p>

<p>The last collapsible boat was being
struggled with on the upper deck, but
there were no seamen about who understood
its stiff mechanism; unaccustomed
hands fumbled desperately with it, and
finally pushed it over the side in its collapsed
condition for use as a raft. Many
of the seamen and stewards had gathered
in the bar-room, where the attendant
was serving out glasses of whiskey to
any and all who came for it; but most
men had an instinct against being under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
cover, and preferred to stand out in the
open.</p>

<p>And now those in the boats that had
drawn off from the ship could see that
the end was at hand. Her bows had gone
under, although the stern was still fairly
high out of the water. She had sunk
down at the forward end of the great
superstructure amidships; her decks were
just awash, and the black throng was
moving aft. The ship was blazing with
light, and the strains of the band were
faintly heard still playing as they had
been commanded to do. But they had
ceased to play the jolly rag-time tunes with
which the bustle and labour of getting off
the boats had been accompanied; solemn
strains, the strains of a hymn, could be
heard coming over the waters. Many
women in the boats, looking back towards
that lighted and subsiding mass, knew
that somewhere, invisible among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
throng, was all that they held dearest in
the world waiting for death; and they
could do nothing. Some tried to get the
crews to turn back, wringing their hands,
beseeching, imploring; but no crew dared
face the neighbourhood of the giant in her
death agony. They could only wait, and
shiver, and look.</p>



<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> end, when it came, was as
gradual as everything else had
been since the first impact. Just as
there was no one moment at which everyone
in the ship realized that she had
suffered damage; just as there was no one
moment when the whole of her company
realized that they must leave her; just as
there was no one moment when all in the
ship understood that their lives were in
peril, and no moment when they all knew
she must sink; so there was no one
moment at which all those left on board
could have said, “She is gone.” At one
moment the floor of the bridge, where the
Captain stood, was awash; the next a
wave came along and covered it with four
feet of water, in which the Captain was
for a moment washed away, although he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
struggled back and stood there again, up
to his knees in water. “Boys, you can
do no more,” he shouted, “look out for
yourselves!” Standing near him was a
fireman and—strange juxtaposition—two
unclaimed solitary little children, scarce
more than babies. The fireman seized one
in his arms, the Captain another; another
wave came and they were afloat in deep
water, striking out over the rail of the
bridge away from the ship.</p>

<p>The slope of the deck increased, and
the sea came washing up against it as
waves wash against a steep shore. And
then that helpless mass of humanity was
stricken at last with the fear of death, and
began to scramble madly aft, away from
the chasm of water that kept creeping up
and up the decks. Then a strange thing
happened. They who had been waiting
to sink into the sea found themselves rising
into the air as the slope of the decks
grew steeper. Up and up, dizzily high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
out of reach of the dark waters into which
they had dreaded to be plunged, higher
and higher into the air, towards the stars,
the stern of the ship rose slowly right out
of the water, and hung there for a time
that is estimated variously between two
and five minutes; a terrible eternity to
those who were still clinging. Many,
thinking the end had come, jumped; the
water resounded with splash after splash
as the bodies, like mice shaken out of a
trap into a bucket, dropped into the water.
All who could do so laid hold of something;
ropes, stanchions, deck-houses,
mahogany doors, window frames, anything,
and so clung on while the stern of
the giant ship reared itself towards the
sky. Many had no hold, or lost the hold
they had, and these slid down the steep
smooth decks, as people slide down a
water chute into the sea.</p>

<p>We dare not linger here, even in imagination;
dare not speculate; dare not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
look closely, even with the mind’s eye, at
this poor human agony, this last pitiful
scramble for dear life that the serene stars
shone down upon. We must either turn
our faces away, or withdraw to that surrounding
circle where the boats were
hovering with their terror-stricken burdens,
and see what they saw. They saw
the after part of the ship, blazing with
light, stand up, a suspended prodigy, between
the stars and the waters; they saw
the black atoms, each one of which they
knew to be a living man or woman on
fire with agony, sliding down like shot
rubbish into the sea; they saw the giant
decks bend and crack; they heard a hollow
and tremendous rumbling as the great
engines tore themselves from their steel
beds and crashed through the ship; they
saw sparks streaming in a golden rain
from one of the funnels; heard the dull
boom of an explosion while the spouting
funnel fell over into the sea with a slap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that killed every one beneath it and set
the nearest boat rocking; heard two more
dull bursting reports as the steel bulkheads
gave way or decks blew up; saw
the lights flicker out, flicker back again,
and then go out for ever, and the ship,
like some giant sea creature forsaking the
strife of the upper elements for the peace
of the submarine depths, launched herself
with one slow plunge and dive beneath
the waves.</p>

<p>There was no great maelstrom as they
had feared, but the sea was swelling and
sinking all about them; and they could
see waves and eddies where rose the
imprisoned air, the smoke and steam of
vomited-up ashes, and a bobbing commotion
of small dark things where the
<i>Titanic</i>, in her pride and her shame, with
the clocks ticking and the fires burning in
her luxurious rooms, had plunged down
to the icy depths of death.</p>



<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> the ship sank and the commotion
and swirl of the waves subsided,
the most terrible experience
of all began. The seas were not
voiceless; the horrified people in the surrounding
boats heard an awful sound
from the dark central area, a collective
voice, compound of moans, shrieks, cries
and despairing calls, from those who
were struggling in the water. It was an
area of death and of agony towards which
those in the boats dared not venture, even
although they knew their own friends
were perishing and crying for help there.
They could only wait and listen, hoping
that it might soon be over. But it was
not soon over. There was a great deal of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
floating wreckage to which hundreds of
people clung, some for a short time, some
for a long time; and while they clung on
they cried out to their friends to save
them. One boat—that commanded by
Mr. Lowe, the Fifth Officer—did, after
transshipping some of its passengers into
other boats, and embarking a crew of
oarsmen, venture back into the dark
centre of things. The wreckage and dead
bodies showed the sea so thickly that they
could hardly row without touching a dead
body; and once, when they were trying
to reach a survivor who was clinging to
a piece of broken staircase, praying and
calling for help, it took them nearly half
an hour to cover the fifty feet that separated
them from him, so thick were the
bodies. This reads like an exaggeration,
but it is well attested. The water was icy
cold, and benumbed many of them, who
thus died quickly; a few held on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
life, moaning, wailing, calling—but in
vain.</p>

<p>A few strong men were still making a
desperate fight for life. The collapsible
boat, which Bride had seen a group of
passengers attempting to launch a few
minutes before the ship sank, was washed
off by a wave in its collapsed condition.
Such boats contain air compartments in
their bottom, and thus, even although
they are not opened, they float like rafts,
and can carry a considerable weight.
Some of those who were swept off the
ship by the same wave that took the boat
found themselves near it and climbed on
to it. Mr. Lightoller, the Second Officer,
had dived as the ship dived, and been
sucked down the steep submerged wall
of the hull against the grating over the
blower for the exhaust steam. Far down
under the water he felt the force of an
explosion which blew him up to the surface,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
where he breathed for a moment,
and was then sucked back by the water
washing into the ship as it sank. This
time he landed against the grating over
the pipes that furnished the draught for
the funnels, and stuck there. There was
another explosion, and again he came to
the surface not many feet from the ship,
and found himself near the collapsible
boat, to which he clung. It was quite
near him that the huge funnel fell over
into the water and killed many swimmers
before his eyes. He drifted for a time on
the collapsible boat, until he was taken
off into one of the lifeboats.</p>

<p>Bride also found himself strangely involved
with this boat, which he had last
seen on the deck of the ship. When he
was swept off, he found himself in the
horrible position of being trapped under
water beneath this boat. He struggled
out and tried to climb on to it, but it took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
him a long time; at last, however, he
managed to get up on it, and found five
or six other people there. And now and
then some other swimmer, stronger than
most, would come up and be helped on
board. Some thus helped died almost
immediately; there were four found dead
upon this boat when at last the survivors
were rescued.</p>

<p>There was another boat also not far
off, a lifeboat, capsized likewise. Six men
managed to scramble on to the keel of
this craft; it was almost all she could
carry. Mr. Caldwell, a second-class passenger,
who had been swimming about in
the icy water for nearly an hour, with
dead bodies floating all about him, was
beginning to despair when he found himself
near a crate to which another man
was clinging. “Will it hold two?” he
asked. And the other man, with a rare
heroism, said: “Catch hold and try; we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
will live or die together.” And these two,
clinging precariously to the crate, reached
the overturned lifeboat and were hauled
up to its keel. Presently another man
came swimming along and asked if they
could take him on. But the boat was already
dangerously loaded; the weight of
another man would have meant death for
all, and they told him so. “All right,”
he cried, “good-bye; God bless you all!”
And he sank before their eyes.</p>

<p>Captain Smith, who had last been seen
washed from the bridge as the ship sank,
with a child in his arms, was seen once
more before he died. He was swimming,
apparently only in the hope of saving the
child that he held; for in his austere conception
of his duty there was no place of
salvation for him while others were drowning
and struggling. He swam up to a
boat with the child and gasped out: “Take
the child!” A dozen willing hands were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
stretched out to take it, and then to help
him into the boat; but he shook them off.
Only for a moment he held on, asking:
“What became of Murdoch?” and when
they said that he was dead, he let go his
hold, saying: “Let me go”; and the
last that they saw of him was swimming
back towards the ship. He had no lifebelt;
he had evidently no wish that there
should be any gruesome resurrection of
his body from the sea, and undoubtedly
he found his grave where he wished to
find it, somewhere hard by the grave of
his ship.</p>

<p>The irony of chance, the merciless and
illogical selection which death makes in a
great collective disaster, was exemplified
over and over again in the deaths of people
who had escaped safely to a boat, and the
salvation of others who were involved
in the very centre of destruction. The
strangest escape of all was probably that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of Colonel Gracie of the United States
army, who jumped from the topmost deck
of the ship when she sank and was sucked
down with her. He was drawn down for
a long while, and whirled round and
round, and would have been drawn down
to a depth from which he could never
have come up alive if it had not been for
the explosion which took place after the
ship sank. “After sinking with the ship,”
he says, “it appeared to me as if I was
propelled by some great force through the
water. This may have been caused by
explosions under the waters, and I remembered
fearful stories of people being
boiled to death. Innumerable thoughts
of a personal nature, having relation to
mental telepathy, flashed through my
brain. I thought of those at home, as if
my spirit might go to them to say good-bye.
Again and again I prayed for deliverance,
although I felt sure that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
end had come. I had the greatest difficulty
in holding my breath until I came
to the surface. I knew that once I inhaled,
the water would suffocate me. I
struck out with all my strength for the
surface. I got to the air again after a
time that seemed to me unending. There
was nothing in sight save the ocean strewn
with great masses of wreckage, dying men
and women all about me, groaning and
crying piteously. I saw wreckage everywhere,
and what came within reach I
clung to. I moved from one piece to
another until I reached the collapsible
boat. She soon became so full that it
seemed as if she would sink if more came
on board her. We had to refuse to let
any others climb on board. This was the
most pathetic and horrible scene of all.
The piteous cries of those around us ring
in my ears, and I will remember them to
my dying day. ‘Hold on to what you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
have, old boy,’ we shouted to each man
who tried to get on board. ‘One more
of you would sink us all.’ Many of those
whom we refused answered, as they went
to their death, ‘Good luck; God bless
you.’ All the time we were buoyed up
and sustained by the hope of rescue. We
saw lights in all directions—particularly
some green lights which, as we learned
later, were rockets burned by one of the
<i>Titanic’s</i> boats. So we passed the night
with the waves washing over and burying
our raft deep in the water.”</p>

<p>It was twenty minutes past two when
the <i>Titanic</i> sank, two hours and forty
minutes after she had struck the iceberg;
and for two hours after that the boats
drifted all round and about, some of them
in bunches of three or four, others solitary.
Almost every kind of suffering was endured
in them, although, after the mental
horrors of the preceding hour, physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
sufferings were scarcely felt. Some of the
boats had hardly anyone but women in
them; in many the stokers and stewards
were quite useless at the oars. But here
and there, in that sorrowful, horror-stricken
company, heroism lifted its head
and human nature took heart again.
Women took their turn at the oars in
boats where the men were either too few
or incapable of rowing; and one woman
notably, the Countess of Rothes, practically
took command of her boat and was
at an oar all the time. Where they were
rowing to most of them did not know.
They had seen lights at the time the ship
went down, and some of them made for
these; but they soon disappeared, and
probably most of the boats were following
each other aimlessly, led by one boat
in which some green flares were found,
which acted as a beacon for which the
others made. One man had a pocket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
electric lamp, which he flashed now and
then, a little ray of hope and guidance
shining across those dark and miserable
waters. Not all of the boats had food and
water on board. Many women were only
in their night-clothes, some of the men in
evening dress; everyone was bitterly cold,
although, fortunately, there was no wind
and no sea.</p>

<p>The stars paled in the sky; the darkness
became a little lighter; the gray daylight
began to come. Out of the surrounding
gloom a wider and wider area
of sea became visible, with here and there
a boat discernible on it, and here and
there some fragments of wreckage. By
this time the boats had rowed away from
the dreadful region, and but few floating
bodies were visible. The waves rose and
fell, smooth as oil, first gray in colour,
and then, as the light increased, the pure
dark blue of mid-ocean. The eastern sky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
began to grow red under the cloud bank,
and from red to orange, and from orange
to gold, the lovely pageantry of an Atlantic
dawn began to unfold itself before
the aching eyes that had been gazing on
prodigies and horrors. From out that
well of light in the sky came rays that
painted the wave-backs first with rose,
and then with saffron, and then with pure
gold. And in the first flush of that blessed
and comforting light the draggled and
weary sufferers saw, first a speck far to
the south, then a smudge of cloud, and
then the red and black smoke-stack of a
steamer that meant succour and safety
for them.</p>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom</span> every quarter of the ocean,
summoned by the miracle of the
wireless voice, many ships had been
racing since midnight to the help of the
doomed liner. From midnight onwards
captains were being called by messages
from the wireless operators of their ships,
telling them that the <i>Titanic</i> was asking
for help; courses were being altered and
chief engineers called upon to urge their
stokehold crews to special efforts; for
coal means steam, and steam means
speed, and speed may mean life. Many
ships that could receive the strong electric
impulses sent out from the <i>Titanic</i> had
not electric strength enough to answer;
but they turned and came to that invisible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
spot represented by a few figures which
the faithful wireless indicated. Even as
far as five hundred miles away, the
<i>Parisian</i> turned in her tracks in obedience
to the call and came racing towards the
north-west. But there were tragedies
even with the wireless. The Leyland liner
<i>Californian</i>, bound for Boston, was only
seventeen miles away from the <i>Titanic</i>
when she struck, and could have saved
every soul on board; but her wireless apparatus
was not working, and she was
deaf to the agonized calls that were being
sent out from only a few miles away. The
<i>Parisian</i>, five hundred miles away, could
hear and come, though it was useless; the
<i>Californian</i> could not hear and so did not
come though, if she had, she would probably
have saved every life on board. The
<i>Cincinnati</i>, the <i>Amerika</i>, the <i>Prinz Friedrich
Wilhelm</i>, the <i>Menominee</i>, the <i>La
Provence</i>, the <i>Prinz Adalbert</i>, the <i>Virginian</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the <i>Olympic</i>, and the <i>Baltic</i> all
heard the news and all turned towards
Lat.&nbsp;41°&nbsp;46′&nbsp;N., Long.&nbsp;50°&nbsp;14′&nbsp;W. The
dread news was being whispered all over
the sea, and even ashore, just as the
dwellers on the North Atlantic seaboard
were retiring to rest, the station at Cape
Race intercepted the talk of the <i>Titanic</i>
270 miles away, and flashed the message
out far and wide; so that Government
tugs and ships with steam up in harbours,
and everything afloat in the vicinity which
heard the news might hurry to the rescue.
Cape Race soon heard that the <i>Virginian</i>
was on her way to the <i>Titanic’s</i> position,
then that the <i>Olympic</i> and <i>Carpathia</i> had
altered their courses and were making for
the wounded ship, and so on. Throughout
the night the rumours in the air were
busy, while still the steady calls came out
in firm electric waves from the <i>Titanic</i>—still
calling, still flashing “C.Q.D.” At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
1.20 she whispered to the <i>Olympic</i>, “Get
your boats ready; going down fast by
the head.” At 1.35 the <i>Frankfurt</i> (after
an hour and a half’s delay) said, “We are
starting for you.” Then at 1.41 came a
message to the <i>Olympic</i>, “C.Q.D., boilers
flooded.”</p>

<p>“Are there any boats round you already?”
asked the <i>Olympic</i>, but there
was no answer.</p>

<p>Other ships began to call, giving encouraging
messages: “We are coming,”
said the <i>Birma</i>, “only fifty miles away”;
but still there was no answer.</p>

<p>All over the North Atlantic men in
lighted instrument rooms sat listening
with the telephones at their ears; they
heard each other’s questions and waited
in the silence, but it was never broken
again by the voice from the <i>Titanic</i>.
“All quiet now,” reported the <i>Birma</i>
to the <i>Olympic</i>, and all quiet it was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
except for the thrashing and pounding
of a score of propellers, and the hiss
of a dozen steel stems as they ripped the
smooth waters on courses converging to
the spot where the wireless voice had suddenly
flickered out into silence.</p>

<p>But of all those who had been listening
to the signals Captain Rostron of the
<i>Carpathia</i> knew that his ship would most
likely be among the first to reach the
spot. It was about midnight on Sunday
that the passengers of the <i>Carpathia</i> first
became aware that something unusual
was happening. The course had been
changed and a certain hurrying about on
the decks took the place of the usual midnight
quiet. The trembling and vibration
increased to a quick jumping movement
as pressure of steam was gradually increased
and the engines urged to the extreme
of their driving capacity. The chief
steward summoned his staff and set them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
to work making sandwiches and preparing
hot drinks. All the hot water was
cut off from the cabins and bath-rooms,
so that every ounce of steam could be
utilized for driving the machinery.</p>

<p>The <i>Carpathia</i> was nearly seventy miles
from the position of the <i>Titanic</i> when she
changed her course and turned northward;
she had been steaming just over
four hours when, in the light of that wonderful
dawn, those on the look-out descried
a small boat. As they drew nearer
they saw other boats, and fragments of
wreckage, and masses of ice drifting
about the sea. Captain Rostron stopped
while he was still a good distance from
the boats, realizing that preparations must
be made before he could take passengers
on board. The accommodation gangway
was rigged and also rope ladders lowered
over the sides, and canvas slings were
arranged to hoist up those who were too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
feeble to climb. The passengers crowded
along the rail or looked out of their portholes
to see the reaping of this strange
harvest of the sea. The first boat came up
almost filled with women and children—women
in evening dress or in fur coats
thrown over nightgowns, in silk stockings
and slippers, in rags and shawls.
The babies were crying; some of the
women were injured and some half-fainting;
all had horror on their faces. Other
boats began to come up, and the work of
embarking the seven hundred survivors
went on. It took a long time, for some of
the boats were far away, and it was not
until they had been seven hours afloat
that the last of them were taken on board
the <i>Carpathia</i>. Some climbed up the ladders,
others were put into the slings and
swung on board, stewards standing by
with rum and brandy to revive the fainting;
and many willing hands were occupied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
with caring for the sufferers, taking
them at once to improvised couches and
beds, or conducting those who were not
so exhausted to the saloon where hot
drinks and food were ready. But it was a
ghastly company. As boat after boat
came up, those who had already been
saved eagerly searched among its occupants
to see if their own friends were
among them; and as gradually the tale
of boats was completed and it was known
that no more had been saved, and the terrible
magnitude of the loss was realized—then,
in the words of one of the <i>Carpathia’s</i>
people, “Bedlam broke loose.”
Women who had borne themselves
bravely throughout the hours of waiting
and exposure broke into shrieking hysterics,
calling upon the names of their
lost. Some went clean out of their minds;
one or two died there in the very moment
of rescue. The <i>Carpathia’s</i> passengers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
gave up their rooms and ransacked their
trunks to find clothing for the more than
half-naked survivors; and at last exhaustion,
resignation, and the doctor’s
merciful drugs did the rest. The dead
were buried; those who had been snatched
too late from the bitter waters were committed
to them again, and eternally, with
solemn words; and the <i>Carpathia</i> was
headed for New York.</p>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> <i>Californian</i> had come up while
the <i>Carpathia</i> was taking the survivors
on board, and it was arranged
that she should remain and search
the vicinity while the <i>Carpathia</i> made all
haste to New York. And the other ships
that had answered the call for help either
came up later in the morning and stayed
for a little cruising about in the forlorn
hope of finding more survivors, or else
turned back and resumed their voyages
when they heard the <i>Carpathia’s</i> tidings.</p>

<p>In the meantime the shore stations
could get no news. Word reached New
York and London in the course of the
morning that the <i>Titanic</i> had struck an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
iceberg and was badly damaged, but
nothing more was known until a message,
the origin of which could not be
discovered, came to say that the <i>Titanic</i>
was being towed to Halifax by the <i>Virginian</i>,
and that all her passengers were
saved. With this news the London evening
papers came out on that Monday,
and even on Tuesday the early editions
of the morning papers had the same story,
and commented upon the narrow escape
of the huge ship. Even the White Star
officials had on Monday no definite news;
and when their offices in New York were
besieged by newspaper men and relatives
of the passengers demanding information,
the pathetic belief in the <i>Titanic’s</i>
strength was allowed to overshadow
anxieties concerning the greater disaster.
Mr. Franklin, the vice-president of the
American Trust to which the White Star
Company belongs, issued the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
statement from New York on Monday:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“We have nothing direct from the
<i>Titanic</i>, but are perfectly satisfied that
the vessel is unsinkable. The fact that
the Marconi messages have ceased means
nothing; it may be due to atmospheric
conditions or the coming up of the ships,
or something of that sort.</p>

<p>“We are not worried over the possible
loss of the ship, as she will not go down,
but we are sorry for the inconvenience
caused to the travelling public. We are
absolutely certain that the <i>Titanic</i> is able
to withstand any damage. She may be
down by the head, but would float indefinitely
in that condition.”</p></div>

<p>Still that same word, “unsinkable,”
which had now indeed for the first time
become a true one: for it is only when
she lies at the bottom of the sea that any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
ship can be called unsinkable. On Tuesday
morning when the dreadful news was
first certainly known, those proud words
had to be taken back. Again Mr. Franklin
had to face the reporters, and this
time he could only say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I must take upon myself the whole
blame for that statement. I made it, and
I believed it when I made it. The accident
to the <i>Olympic</i>, when she collided
with the cruiser <i>Hawke</i>, convinced me that
these ships, the <i>Olympic</i> and <i>Titanic</i>,
were built like battleships, able to resist
almost any kind of accident, particularly
a collision. I made the statement in good
faith, and upon me must rest the responsibility
for error, since the fact has
proved that it was not a correct description
of the unfortunate <i>Titanic</i>.”</p></div>

<p>And for three days while the <i>Carpathia</i>
was ploughing her way, now slowly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
through ice-strewn seas, and now at full
speed through open water, and while
England lay under the cloud of an unprecedented
disaster, New York was in a
ferment of grief, excitement, and indignation.
Crowds thronged the streets outside
the offices of the White Star Line,
while gradually, in lists of thirty or forty
at a time, the names of the survivors
began to come through from the <i>Carpathia</i>.
And at last, when all the names
had been spelled out, and interrogated,
and corrected, the grim total of the figures
stood out in appalling significance—seven
hundred and three saved, one thousand
five hundred and three lost.</p>

<p>It is not possible, nor would it be very
profitable, to describe the scenes that took
place on these days of waiting, the alternations
of hope and grief, of thankfulness
and wild despair, of which the shipping
offices were the scene. They culminated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
on the Thursday evening when the <i>Carpathia</i>
arrived in New York. The greatest
precautions had been taken to prevent the
insatiable thirst for news from turning
that solemn disembarkation into a battlefield.
The entrance to the dock was carefully
guarded, and only those were admitted
who had business there or who
could prove that they had relations among
the rescued passengers. Similar precautions
were taken on the ship; she was not
even boarded by the Custom officials, nor
were any reporters allowed on board, although
a fleet of steam launches went out
in the cold rainy evening to meet her,
bearing pressmen who were prepared to
run any risks to get a footing on the
ship. They failed, however, and the small
craft were left behind in the mist, as the
<i>Carpathia</i> came gliding up the Hudson.</p>

<p>Among the waiting crowd were nurses,
doctors, and a staff of ambulance men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and women; for all kinds of wild rumours
were afloat as to the condition of those
who had been rescued. The women of New
York had devoted the days of waiting to
the organization of a powerful relief committee,
and had collected money and clothing
on an ample scale to meet the needs
of those, chiefly among the steerage passengers,
who should find themselves destitute
when they landed. And there, in the
rain of that gloomy evening, they waited.</p>

<p>At last they saw the <i>Carpathia</i> come
creeping up the river and head towards
the White Star pier. The flashlights of
photographers were playing about her,
and with this silent salute she came into
dock. Gateways had been erected, shutting
off the edge of the pier from the sheds
in which the crowd was waiting, and the
first sight they had of the rescued was
when after the gangway had been rigged,
and the brief formalities of the shore complied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
with, the passengers began slowly
to come down the gangway. A famous
English dramatist who was looking on at
the scene has written of it eloquently, describing
the strange varieties of bearing
and demeanour; how one face had a
startled, frightened look that seemed as
if it would always be there, another a set
and staring gaze; how one showed an
angry, rebellious desperation, and another
seemed merely dazed. Some carried on
stretchers, some supported by nurses, and
some handed down by members of the
crew, they came, either to meetings that
were agonizing in their joy, or to blank
loneliness that would last until they died.
Five or six babies without mothers, some
of them utterly unidentified and unidentifiable,
were handed down with the rest, so
strangely preserved, in all their tenderness
and helplessness, through that terrible
time of confusion and exposure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>And in the minds of those who looked
on at this sad procession there was one
tragic, recurrent thought: that for every
one who came down the gangway, ill
perhaps, maimed perhaps, destitute perhaps,
but alive and on solid earth again,
there were two either drifting in the slow
Arctic current, or lying in the great submarine
valley to which the ship had gone
down. They were a poor remnant indeed
of all that composite world of pride, and
strength, and riches; for Death winnows
with a strange fan, and although one
would suit his purpose as well as another,
he often chooses the best and the
strongest. There were card-sharpers, and
orphaned infants, and destitute consumptives
among the saved; and there were
hundreds of heroes and strong men
among the drowned. There were among
the saved those to whom death would
have been no great enemy, who had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
love for life or ties to bind them to it;
and there were those among the drowned
for whom life was at its very best and
dearest; lovers and workers in the very
morning of life before whom the years
had stretched forward rich with promise.</p>

<p>And when nearly all had gone and the
crowd in the docks was melting away,
one man, who had until then remained
secluded in the ship came quietly out,
haggard and stricken with woe: Bruce
Ismay, the representative and figure-head
of that pride and power which had given
being to the <i>Titanic</i>. In a sense he bore
on his own shoulders the burden of every
sufferer’s grief and loss; and he bore it,
not with shame, for he had no cause for
shame, but with reticence of words and
activity in such alleviating deeds as were
possible, and with a dignity which was
proof against even the bitter injustice of
which he was the victim in the days that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
followed. There was pity enough in New
York, hysterical pity, sentimental pity,
real pity, practical pity, for all the obvious
and patent distress of the bereaved and
destitute; but there was no pity for this
man who, of all that ragged remnant that
walked back to life down the <i>Carpathia’s</i>
gangway, had perhaps the most need
of pity.</p>



<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> symbols of Honour and Glory
and Time that looked so handsome
in the flooding sunlight of
the <i>Titanic’s</i> stairway lie crushed into
unrecognizable shapes and splinters beneath
the tonnage of two thousand
fathoms of ocean water. Time is no more
for the fifteen hundred souls who perished
with them; but Honour and Glory, by
strange ways and unlooked-for events,
have come into their own. It was not
Time, nor the creatures and things of
Time, that received their final crown
there; but things that have nothing to
do with Time, qualities that, in their
power of rising beyond all human limitations,
we must needs call divine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Titanic</i> was in more senses than
one a fool’s paradise. There is nothing
that man can build that nature cannot
destroy, and far as he may advance in
might and knowledge and cunning, her
blind strength will always be more than
his match. But men easily forget this;
they wish to forget it; and the beautiful
and comfortable and agreeable equipment
of this ship helped them to forget it. You
may cover the walls of a ship with rare
woods and upholster them with tapestries
and brocades, but it is the bare steel walls
behind them on which you depend to keep
out the water; it is the strength of those
walls, relatively to the strength of such
natural forces as may be arrayed against
them, on which the safety of the ship depends.
If they are weaker than something
which assails them, the water must
come in and the ship must sink. It was
assumed too readily that, in the case of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the <i>Titanic</i>, these things could not happen;
it was assumed too readily that if in
the extreme event they did happen, the
manifold appliances for saving life would
be amply sufficient for the security of the
passengers. Thus they lived in a serene
confidence such as no ship’s company
ever enjoyed before, or will enjoy again
for a long time to come. And there
were gathered about them almost all
those accessories of material life which
are necessary to the paradise of fools,
and are extremely agreeable to wiser
men.</p>

<p>It was this perfect serenity of their condition
which made so poignant the tragedy
of their sudden meeting with death—that
pale angel whom every man knows that
he must some day encounter, but whom
most of us hope to find at the end of
some road a very long way off waiting
for us with comforting and soothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
hands. We do not expect to meet him
suddenly turning the corner of the street,
or in an environment of refined and
elegant conviviality, or in the midst of
our noonday activities, or at midnight on
the high seas when we are dreaming on
feather pillows. But it was thus that
those on the <i>Titanic</i> encountered him,
waiting there in the ice and the starlight,
arresting the ship’s progress with his out-stretched
arm, and standing by, waiting,
while the sense of his cold presence
gradually sank like a frost into their
hearts.</p>

<p>To say that all the men who died on
the <i>Titanic</i> were heroes would be as absurd
as to say that all who were saved were
cowards. There were heroes among both
groups and cowards among both groups,
as there must be among any large number
of men. It is the collective behaviour and
the general attitude towards disaster that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
is important at such a time; and in this
respect there is ample evidence that death
scored no advantage in the encounter,
and that, though he took a spoil of bodies
that had been destined for him since the
moment of their birth, he left the hearts
unconquered. In that last half-hour before
the end, when every one on the ship was
under sentence of death, modern civilization
went through a severe test. By their
bearing in that moment those fated men
and women had to determine whether,
through the long years of peace and increase
of material comfort and withdrawal
from contact with the cruder elements of
life, their race had deteriorated in courage
and morale. It is only by such great
tests that we can determine how we stand
in these matters, and, as they periodically
recur, measure our advance or decline.
And the human material there made the
test a very severe one; for there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
people on the <i>Titanic</i> who had so entrenched
themselves behind ramparts of
wealth and influence as to have wellnigh
forgotten that, equally with the waif and
the pauper, they were exposed to the
caprice of destiny; and who might have
been forgiven if, in that awful moment of
realization, they had shown the white
feather and given themselves over to
panic. But there is ample evidence that
these men stood the test equally as well
as those whose occupation and training
made them familiar with the risks of the
sea, to which they were continually exposed,
and through which they might
reasonably expect to come to just such
an end. There was no theatrical heroism,
no striking of attitudes, or attempt to
escape from the dread reality in any form
of spiritual hypnosis; they simply stood
about the decks, smoking cigarettes, talking
to one another, and waiting for their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
hour to strike. There is nothing so hard,
nothing so entirely dignified, as to be
silent and quiet in the face of an approaching
horror.</p>

<p>That was one form of heroism, which
will make the influence of this thing
deathless long after the memory of it has
faded as completely from the minds of
men as sight or sign of it has faded from
that area of ocean where, two miles above
the sunken ship, the rolling blue furrows
have smoothed away all trace of the
struggles and agonies that embittered it.
But there was another heroism which
must be regarded as the final crown and
glory of this catastrophe—not because it
is exceptional, for happily it is not, but
because it continued and confirmed a
tradition of English sea life that should
be a tingling inspiration to everyone who
has knowledge of it. The men who did
the work of the ship were no composite,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
highly drilled body like the men in the
navy who, isolated for months at a time
and austerely disciplined, are educated
into an <i>esprit de corps</i> and sense of responsibility
that make them willing, in
moments of emergency, to sacrifice individual
safety to the honour of the ship
and of the Service to which they belong.
These stokers, stewards, and seamen were
the ordinary scratch crew, signed on at
Southampton for one round trip to New
York and back; most of them had never
seen each other or their officers before;
they had none of the training or the securities
afforded by a great national service;
they were simply—especially in the
case of the stokers—men so low in the
community that they were able to live no
pleasanter life than that afforded by the
stokehold of a ship—an inferno of darkness
and noise and commotion and insufferable
heat—men whose experience of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the good things of life was half an hour’s
breathing of the open sea air between
their spells of labour at the furnaces, or
a drunken spree ashore whence, after
being poisoned by cheap drink and robbed
by joyless women of the fruits of their
spell of labour, they are obliged to return
to it again to find the means for another
debauch. Not the stuff out of which one
would expect an austere heroism to be
evolved. Yet such are the traditions of
the sea, such is the power of those traditions
and the spirit of those who interpret
them, that some of these men—not all,
but some—remained down in the <i>Titanic’s</i>
stokeholds long after she had struck, and
long after the water, pouring like a cataract
through the rent in her bottom and rising
like a tide round the black holes where
they worked, had warned them that her
doom, and probably theirs, was sealed.</p>

<p>In the engine-room were another group<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of heroes, men of a far higher type, with
fine intelligences, trained in all the subtleties
and craft of modern ships, men
with education and imagination who could
see in their mind’s eye all the variations
of horror that might await them. These
men also continued at their routine tasks
in the engine room, knowing perfectly
well that no power on earth could save
them, choosing to stay there while there
was work to be done for the common
good, their best hope being presently to
be drowned instead of being boiled or
scalded to death. All through the ship,
though in less awful circumstances, the
same spirit was being observed; men who
had duties to do went on doing them because
they were the kind of men to whom
in such an hour it came more easily to
perform than to shirk their duties. The
three ship’s boys spent the whole of that
hour carrying provisions from the store-room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to the deck; the post-office employés
worked in the flooded mail-room
below to save the mail-bags and carry
them up to where they might be taken off
if there should be a chance; the purser
and his men brought up the ship’s books
and money, against all possibility of its
being any use to do so, but because it was
their duty at such a time to do so; the
stewards were busy to the end with their
domestic, and the officers with their executive,
duties. In all this we have an example
of spontaneous discipline—for they
had never been drilled in doing these
things, they only knew that they had to
do them—such as no barrack-room discipline
in the world could match. In such
moments all artificial bonds are useless.
It is what men are in themselves that determines
their conduct; and discipline and
conduct like this are proofs, not of the
superiority of one race over another, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that in the core of human nature itself
there is an abiding sweetness and soundness
that fear cannot embitter nor death
corrupt.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">The twin gray horses are still at their
work in Belfast Lough, and on any summer
morning you may see their white
manes shining like gold as they escort you
in from the sunrise and the open sea to
where the smoke rises and the din resounds.</p>

<p>For the iron forest has branched again,
and its dreadful groves are echoing anew
to the clamour of the hammers and the
drills. Another ship, greater and stronger
even than the lost one, is rising within the
cathedral scaffoldings; and the men who
build her, companions of those whom the
<i>Titanic</i> spilled into the sea, speak among
themselves and say, “this time we shall
prevail.”</p>

Portrait, Maps, Illustrations, Appendices and a Note
on the Navigation of Columbus’s First Voyage by
the Earl of Dunraven, K.P. Large Post 8vo, cloth, gilt.
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net. (Third Edition.)</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Vignaud, late Secretary of the American Embassy
and distinguished historian of Columbus, says:</p>

<p>“<i>In this book the hero who discovered the New World is shown
for the first time as a living man.... A more true and lively
picture of the great discoverer than is contained in any other
work.</i>”</p>

<p>“Mr. Filson Young has done nothing better ... there is not
a dull page in the seven hundred. His descriptions of visible
things, of streets and hills, and seas and men, are vivid in his
accustomed manner. His narrative is rich and marching, yet
sufficiently precise.... For the modern taste there is really
nothing about Columbus to compare with Mr. Young’s for matter
and style.”—<i>The Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>“If these volumes do not bring the figure of Columbus into
closer relation with the mind of the present generation, it must
be because people simply do not care to learn about anything
that lies a few yards beyond their own thresholds. Our hope,
however, is better; and we imagine that there will be a wide
public for a narrative so fresh and spirited.</p>

<p>“Mr. Filson Young tells his story, without turning to the right
hand or to the left, in a free and fluent fashion.... Very vigorous
too are the passages dealing with his voyages, for Mr. Filson
Young has drunk deep of the spirit of the sea and nowhere writes
so well as in his account of the seafarer’s business in great waters....
The book abounds in interludes of suggestive thought and
clear, vigorous expression. But, the book must be commended
for the keen, eager spirit of its narrative and the abounding interest
of its romances. If all gleaners in the field of history were
as skilful as Mr. Young, we should not hear so much about the
dry-as-dust dullness of what ought to be always one of the most
fascinating forms of literary art.”</p>

<p class="right" style="margin-bottom: 2em">Mr. W.&nbsp;L. Courtney in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>

<p>“Mr. Young has given us an estimate of the man which is
attractive and poetical. His account of the four voyages to the
Indies is a romance of the sea.... His book is a book of colour
and the spirit of adventure. We delight in that vision of his
which shows to others the world and the sea and the strange
‘Indias’ very much as Columbus saw them, with his keen eyes,
four centuries ago.”—<i>The Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p>“History clothed with a gracious humanity ... history that
has reality and life ... not a mere record of his acts, but a reconstruction
of the man who died four centuries ago, so that at
the end of the book we feel that we have known and spoken with
Columbus.... Breathes interest from every page.”—<i>The Daily
Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>“He writes with charm, with colour, and with humour ...
very readable and eloquent.... We can give but a little quotation
to show Mr. Young’s eloquence, but we can assure the
reader that he has many passages that set one longing for the
sea.”—Mr. John Masefield in <i>The Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“It is almost impossible to do justice to the splendour and
romance of these two finely produced volumes.... ‘Charity,
truth, and justice,’ that is the meed Columbus has from Mr.
Filson Young, whose book—austere, dignified, stately—forms by
far the most striking and vivid portrait of the hero in our language.”—<i>The
Morning Leader.</i></p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 2em">“To write a new book on Columbus seems a daring project;
so many folios have already been dedicated to his life. Mr.
Young has justified himself; so many books on the Genoese
sailor have been either unexpectedly dull or painfully inaccurate.
Mr. Young is neither; in a style pleasant and lucid he has set
before us with vigour the period and the setting of these famous
voyages. In his pages we can enter into the feelings and aspirations
of those Western seamen.”—<i>The Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>
